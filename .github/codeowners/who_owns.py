"""who_owns.py -- "who reviews this?" from a generated CODEOWNERS (+ advisory).

The CODEOWNERS file is a machine input: GitHub auto-requests the owning team
when a PR opens. This tool answers the human question on demand, so nobody
has to read 300 rules to find a reviewer.

  # owners of specific paths (last-match-wins, exactly as GitHub resolves)
  python who_owns.py --codeowners CODEOWNERS lib/llm/foo.rs components/.../snapshot.py

  # the teams that will be auto-requested on your PR (union over changed files)
  python who_owns.py --codeowners CODEOWNERS --changed --base main

Owners listed on a single line are co-owners (any one's approval satisfies
the gate). Advisory teams are auto-requested too, but never block the merge.

The CODEOWNERS parser and matcher live in ``codeowners_match`` so this tool
resolves a path exactly the same way ``emit_codeowners.py`` routes it -- there
is no second implementation that could drift.
