# Benchmark Evidence Eligibility

Separate evidence that can decide candidate promotion from observations that can only motivate a hypothesis.

## Decision-Grade Evidence

A benchmark result may support a gain, loss, Pareto, SLO, or promotion claim only when:

- it was produced through the canonical AIPerf path for the optimization run;
- its raw outputs remain unchanged and traceable to the executed configuration;
- `benchmark_audit.json` reports `valid` or `valid_with_recovery`;
- its benchmark-series identity matches the comparison target;
- its workload, endpoint, candidate, and execution identity are recorded; and
- no unresolved correctness, request-integrity, or benchmark-isolation issue invalidates the measurement.

Failed and invalid runs remain part of the experiment history, but they cannot establish performance gains.
