"""Regression test for the unified-backend worker tracing subscriber.

A silent regression once removed `logging::init()` from the PyO3
`Worker.run()` path. Workers running under `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED=1`
spawned with NO tracing subscriber → zero spans, zero log lines, zero
observability. The frontend stayed functional, so request-flow tests
passed while telemetry was fully broken.

Asserts the `engine.generate` `SPAN_FIRST_ENTRY` event lands in the
worker's JSONL log with its declared attributes. Catches future
regressions that drop the subscriber install or the auto-span schema.
