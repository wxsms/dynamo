EFA verification deploy test for vLLM.

Verifies that an EFA-tagged image built from the commit under test can run
Dynamo with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) fully enabled: a disaggregated vLLM
stack deploys on an EFA-capable cluster, serves a chat completion, and the
prefill->decode KV-cache transfer rides NIXL -> LIBFABRIC -> EFA.

The deployment flow and every assertion live in tests/deploy/efa_utils.py and
are shared with the SGLang lane (test_deploy_efa_sglang.py); this file carries
only what is specific to vLLM.

This test is NOT part of the auto-discovered deploy-test matrix. It uses an
explicit manifest (tests/deploy/efa/disagg-efa.yaml) and the
``framework_with_efa`` marker, and only makes sense on a cluster with p5/EFA
nodes (the standard CI vCluster lacks RDMA/EFA, which is why the matrix test
skips vLLM disagg). Run it explicitly, e.g.:

    pytest tests/deploy/test_deploy_efa.py -m framework_with_efa \
        --image=<efa-vllm-runtime-image> --namespace=<ns> -v -s

The deployment name is fixed, so the namespace must be clear of a previous
run before starting a new one -- back-to-back manual runs collide with the
prior teardown. CI is unaffected: every nightly gets a fresh vCluster.

Runs nightly, against the nightly -efa image, rather than per-commit: EFA
changes are sparse and this needs a real EFA cluster, two GPUs and roughly three
minutes, which is far more than the per-commit risk warrants.
