"""Shared machinery for the per-framework EFA verification deploy tests.

One deployment flow and one set of assertions, parameterised by an
:class:`EfaFrameworkProfile`, so that ``test_deploy_efa.py`` (vLLM) and
``test_deploy_efa_sglang.py`` (SGLang) prove the same thing about their own
framework and a fix to the evidence rules cannot land in one copy only.

What differs between frameworks is only *how the KV moves*, and that is exactly
what the profile carries: which worker initiates the NIXL transfer, which NIXL
telemetry counter therefore grows, and which pair of EFA adapter counters the
transfer shows up in. The evidence rules themselves -- LIBFABRIC backend on
every worker, no UCX anywhere, libfabric's own EFA memory-registration lines,
adapter counters that moved -- are identical and live here.

    4. Baselines the NIXL agent byte counter on the worker that initiates the
       transfer, and both workers' own EFA adapter counters
    5. Sends a chat completion (which requires a prefill->decode KV transfer)
    6. Validates the response
    7. Asserts the worker logs prove NIXL used the LIBFABRIC/EFA backend, that
       the NIXL counter grew, and that each worker's own EFA adapter moved the
       bytes -- i.e. KV physically crossed EFA, not just that the path was
       configured.
