"""The smart sweep: SearchSpace -> ranked candidates (best-first).

One Vizier study per ``deployment_mode`` branch searches the parallel-config + knob
space (backend is one of the knobs); each suggestion is unrolled, translated to a
deployment, evaluated by replay, scored, and fed back to the optimizer; feasible
candidates are ranked across branches.

Each round is a **barrier**: the study suggests trials until ``per_round`` unique full
samples complete successfully (ask), they are evaluated **in parallel across worker
processes** (``SweepConfig.parallel_evals``; ``<= 1`` runs sequentially), then their
scores are fed back (tell). Exact duplicates use a run-local result cache and trigger
replacement asks. Vizier ask/tell stay on the main process — workers run only the pure
unroll->deploy->replay->score and never touch the study (the Vizier trial handle never
crosses the process boundary). The load-predictor winner is resolved once and injected
into every unroll.

``evaluator`` and ``sampler_factory`` are injectable so the loop is unit-testable
without real replay / Vizier (use ``parallel_evals=1`` to avoid spawning processes).
