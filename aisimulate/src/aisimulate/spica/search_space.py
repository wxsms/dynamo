"""Build the per-branch candidate space the sampler searches over.

A *branch* is one **deployment_mode** (agg / disagg) — one Vizier study each, since
agg and disagg have structurally different parallel configs. ``backend`` is NOT a
branch: it is a searched categorical knob within the study. For each mode we take the
**union** of every configured backend's KV-feasible parallel configs
(:func:`aisimulate.spica.model_hw.parallel_configs_for`) as the valid projection pool, recording per
config which backends support it. The sampler projects structured latent features onto this
pool. Backends with no perf DB, no viable config, or no replay support for a mode are dropped
from the backend knob.

``load_predictor_candidates`` is resolved separately by the load-predictor sub-sweep
and is not a sampler dimension.
