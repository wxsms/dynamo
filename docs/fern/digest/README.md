# Adding a Blog Post

Follow these steps to publish a post in the Dynamo Blog tab.

## Step 1: Write the Post

Create an MDX file under `docs/digest/` using a topic folder when the post has supporting images:

```text
docs/digest/my-post/my-post.mdx
```

Use kebab-case for the filename. Add the standard SPDX header and metadata:

```yaml
---
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025-2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
title: Your Blog Post Title
description: A one-sentence summary for search results and social previews.
keywords: Dynamo, inference
last-updated: July 22, 2026
---
```

Import and render the editorial metadata component immediately after the frontmatter:

```mdx
import { BlogArticleMeta } from "@/components/BlogArticleMeta";

<BlogArticleMeta
  authors={[
    { name: "Author One", github: "verified-handle" },
    { name: "Author Two", href: "https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/verified-profile/" },
  ]}
  category="Engineering"
  date="July 22, 2026"
  readTime="8 min read"
/>
```

Estimate reading time from the body word count at approximately 200 words per minute.
Only add `github` after verifying that the account belongs to the credited author. Git blame and
commit authorship are not substitutes for editorial authorship. Authors without a verified profile
render with an initials avatar and name tooltip.

The `category` selects the article's generated editorial cover palette and flow labels. Supporting
images in the article body receive the standard focus-to-sharp scroll reveal automatically.

## Step 2: Add the Post to the Blog Navigation

Open `docs/fern/index.yml`, find the `blog` tab, and add the post at the correct position in the reverse-chronological list:

```yaml
contents:
  - page: Your Blog Post Title
    path: digest/my-post/my-post.mdx
    slug: my-post
```

Keep the explicit `slug` stable after publication. The public URL is `/dynamo/dev/digest/my-post`.

## Step 3: Add the Post to the Landing Page

Open `docs/fern/components/BlogLanding.tsx` and add an entry to `ARTICLES` in reverse chronological order:

```tsx
{
  title: "Your Blog Post Title",
  description: "A concise summary of the post.",
  href: "/dynamo/dev/digest/my-post",
  date: "July 22, 2026",
  readTime: "8 min read",
  category: "Engineering",
  art: "indexer",
},
```

Use an existing `art` treatment unless the post needs a deliberately new visual direction. The landing page uses custom React and CSS rather than Fern card components.

## Step 4: Add the Sidebar Date Label

Add the post date to the Blog archive selectors in `docs/fern/main.css`. Scope the selector to the post slug so the label appears only in the Blog sidebar.
