title: DynoSim Replay CLI Reference
subtitle: Command options, YAML sections, constraints, and output for aisimulate predict
---

`aisimulate predict --stack dynamo` evaluates one concrete workload and deployment configuration
through the Dynamo simulation stack. AISimulate owns the traffic and engine schema. The `ai-dynamo`
package supplies the Dynamo runner and the optional `router` and `planner` configuration adapters.

For an end-to-end workflow, see
[Run a DynoSim Simulation](../../cli/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/dynosim-replay.mdx). To
search configuration domains, see
[Sweep DynoSim Configurations](../../cli/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/dynosim-sweeps.mdx).

<Warning>
The former Replay `online` mode has no replacement in the unified AISimulate CLI yet. `aisimulate
predict` and `aisimulate recommend` are offline-only. The separate `python3 -m dynamo.mocker`
command remains available for launching live workers but does not provide replay orchestration.
</Warning>

## Command

```bash
aisimulate predict --stack dynamo --config prediction.yaml
```

<ParamField path="-c, --config" type="path" required={true}>
  YAML prediction configuration. Prediction files contain concrete values and reject search
  domains, presets, `optimization`, and `optimizer`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--stack" type="string" default="engine">
  Execution stack. Set this option to `dynamo` to load the Dynamo runner and the Router and Planner
  adapters registered by `ai-dynamo`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--set" type="PATH=YAML_VALUE" default="null">
  Override a schema-valid configuration path after loading the YAML file. Repeat the option for
  multiple overrides. Values are parsed as YAML, and later assignments win. Sequence indexes are
  not supported.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output-dir" type="path" default="./aisimulate-output">
  Directory for `prediction.json` and optional per-request output.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--overwrite" type="flag" default="false">
  Replace known AISimulate output files in an existing nonempty output directory. Unrelated files
  are preserved.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--format" type="string" default="table">
  Standard-output format.

  <span className="enum-values"><span className="enum-label">Allowed values:</span> <Badge intent="note" minimal>table</Badge> <Badge intent="note" minimal>json</Badge></span>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--capture-per-request" type="flag" default="false">
  Write one record per request to `requests.jsonl`.
</ParamField>

## Configuration Sections

The YAML document uses these top-level sections:

| Section | Required | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `traffic` | No | AISimulate | Request source, load pattern, and stopping condition |
| `engine` | Yes | AISimulate | Model, backend, hardware, topology, worker parallelism, scheduler, KV cache, and timing |
| `router` | No | Dynamo adapter | Round-robin or KV-aware routing |
| `planner` | No | Dynamo adapter | Planner policy and scaling behavior |
| `evaluation` | No | AISimulate | Service-level objective (SLO) thresholds used for reporting |

Unknown fields are rejected. `predict` accepts only concrete values. Use `aisimulate recommend` for
`choices`, `range`, or `preset` domains.

## Traffic Rules

`traffic` contains `source`, `load`, and `stop` mappings.

- Omitting the entire section creates 100 independent synthetic requests at concurrency 10, with
  1,024 input tokens and 128 output tokens per request.
- `source.type: synthetic` creates independent requests with `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`.
- `source.type: synthetic-session` creates ordered multi-turn sessions.
- `source.type: trace` reads one or more paths. Supported formats include `mooncake`,
  `mooncake-delta`, `agentic_mooncake`, `weka`, `applied_compute_agentic`, and `dynamo`.
- `load.type: concurrency` keeps a fixed number of requests or sessions active.
- `load.type: constant_rate` schedules evenly spaced arrivals from `requests_per_second` or
  `sessions_per_second`.
- `load.type: poisson` uses the matching rate with exponential inter-arrival times and an optional
  `seed`, which defaults to 42.
- `load.type: trace_timestamps` preserves trace timing and accepts a positive `speedup`.
- `stop.requests` applies to independent requests. `stop.sessions` applies to session sources.
- `stop.requests_per_load_unit` and `stop.sessions_per_load_unit` derive the count from the concrete
  concurrency or arrival rate.
- `stop.max_virtual_time_seconds` is a soft virtual-time cutoff. Requests admitted before the
  cutoff may finish afterward.

For Dynamo request traces, omit `traffic.source.block_size`; Dynamo derives it from the source and
rejects mixed block sizes across shards. For Weka corpora, AISimulate derives the block size from the
source. An explicitly configured Weka block size is only an assertion against the published source
metadata. Dynamo format accepts multiple trace shards. Weka accepts one file or directory; other
formats accept exactly one file.

For Weka traces, `traffic.source.nested_timestamp_basis` controls how nested timestamps
are interpreted:

- `auto` (the default) scans the entire corpus and selects one basis for all nested requests.
  If any replayable child timestamp precedes its parent marker, it selects `relative`;
  otherwise, it selects `absolute`. A corpus without replayable nested requests resolves to
  `not_applicable`. It does not choose a separate basis for each child or file.
- `absolute` uses timestamps directly and rejects a child timestamp before its parent marker,
  apart from the importer's timestamp-rounding tolerance.
- `relative` adds the parent marker's timestamp to each child timestamp.

Explicit `absolute` and `relative` overrides take precedence over inference. For example, a marker
at 1 second with a child timestamp of 2 seconds is interpreted as 3 seconds with `relative`, and
as 2 seconds with `absolute`. `auto` chooses 2 seconds for that corpus unless another child
provides evidence for relative timestamps.

AISimulate's Weka importer also changes two behaviors from the former Dynamo importer:

- A source request with `out: 0` retains zero output tokens and runs as a prefill-only request.
  The former importer used `max(1, out)`. Output-token counts, throughput, and timing metrics
  can therefore change for the same corpus.
- A missing or null `api_time` remains absent (`None`) in `recorded_api_time_ms`, preserving
  the distinction from an explicit zero. Dependency classification uses a zero-duration
  interval at the request timestamp when that duration is unknown. These requests were
  previously rejected. The fallback can affect inferred dependency edges and replay timing;
  it does not assert that the measured API duration was zero.

`mooncake-delta`, `agentic_mooncake`, and `weka` require aggregated engine mode.
The two agentic formats also require `trace_timestamps` and reject the virtual-time cutoff.
`applied_compute_agentic` requires concurrency load.
With the Dynamo stack, omit `planner` or set `planner.policy: disabled` for `mooncake-delta`,
`agentic_mooncake`, and Dynamo traces that carry `agent_context` records.

### Typed agentic replay through the Dynamo API

AISimulate owns public Weka ingestion, validation, and lowering into the canonical
`ValidatedAgenticGraph`. The lower-level
`dynamo.replay.run_trace_replay(...)` API keeps `trace_format="weka"` as a compatibility adapter,
but delegates graph construction directly to `aisimulate-core` before Dynamo composes its Router
and Mocker runtime behavior.

Use `weka_nested_timestamp_basis="absolute"` or `"relative"` to override nested timestamp
interpretation in `run_trace_replay(...)`. Omitting it preserves the `auto` heuristic.

Set `agentic_lanes` to a positive integer to replay a fixed number of trajectories concurrently.
Plays are stable-sorted and stride-assigned to lanes. A lane starts its next play only after its
current play is quiescent, and lanes do not steal work. Agentic replay rejects
`replay_concurrency` and Planner scaling. A Weka corpus may retain multiple source-model labels as
provenance, but the current runtime projects every node onto the single configured
`execution_model`. Per-node heterogeneous timing models are not yet supported.

```python
from dynamo.mocker import MockEngineArgs
from dynamo.replay import run_trace_replay

report = run_trace_replay(
    trace_files="traces/weka-agentx",
    trace_format="weka",
    execution_model="Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8",
    agentic_lanes=12,
    router_mode="kv_router",
    num_workers=4,
    extra_engine_args=MockEngineArgs(engine_type="vllm", block_size=64),
)
```

Agentic reports retain the sorted source-model labels in `agentic_graph.source_models` and record
the explicit projection policy and target in `agentic_model_projection`.

Weka reports also expose the resolved timestamp basis as the string
`weka_nested_timestamp_basis`: `absolute`, `relative`, or `not_applicable`. For offline
`run_trace_replay(...)`, read `report.summary["weka_nested_timestamp_basis"]`; online replay
includes the same field in its summary dictionary. The Dynamo runner includes it in
`report.metadata`, including when raw-report capture is disabled. The requested basis remains
in the workload configuration.

Agentic Mooncake v2 begins with a required versioned header:

```json
{"schema":"dynamo.agentic_mooncake","version":2,"block_size":64,"hash_id_scope":"local","source":{"format":"weka","digest":"<corpus-digest>"}}
```

Each request row contains a globally unique `request_id`, nonempty `play_id`, `session_id`, `model`,
exact input and output metadata, `hash_ids`, and `not_before_ms`. Optional
`source_play_ordinal` and `recorded_api_time_ms` fields preserve source ordering and recorded timing
evidence. The optional `dependencies` array contains typed incoming edges. Each edge identifies its
predecessor, a `dispatch` or `completion` trigger, a nonnegative delay, and a `sequence`, `spawn`,
`join`, or `replay_barrier` relation.

Agentic Mooncake v2 remains an optional materialized interchange format. Dynamo intentionally does
not ship a Weka parser, lowering implementation, or Weka-to-v2 converter; those source semantics
and any future materialization tooling belong to AISimulate.

## Engine and Adapter Rules

- `engine.mode: aggregated` requires `engine.workers.aggregated`.
- `engine.mode: disaggregated` requires `engine.workers.prefill`,
  `engine.workers.decode`, and `engine.kv_transfer`.
- `aisimulate predict` and `aisimulate recommend` currently support TensorRT-LLM only in
  aggregated mode. This is an offline simulation limitation; Dynamo runtime deployments support
  TensorRT-LLM disaggregated serving.
- Each `parallelism` mapping is concrete and contains `replicas`, `tensor`, `pipeline`,
  `attention_data`, `moe_tensor`, and `moe_expert`.
- `engine.context_length` defaults to `max`, which AISimulate resolves from the model's Hugging Face
  configuration. Default KV block sizes are 64 for vLLM, 1 for SGLang, and 32 for TensorRT-LLM.
- Scheduler defaults are 8,192 batched tokens for every role and 256 sequences for aggregated and
  decode workers. Prefill workers default to one sequence.
- `timing.type: default` uses the AIConfigurator forward-pass model shipped in the `aisimulate`
  wheel. `fixed` requires both `prefill_ms` and `decode_ms`; `polynomial` selects the built-in
  polynomial model.
- `router.policy: kv_router` requires more than one routable worker. Set
  `router.prefill_load_model.type` to `none` or `aic`.
- `planner.policy` is `disabled` or `enabled`. When enabled, `planner.max_num_gpus` limits the
  Planner runtime budget; it is distinct from recommendation candidate constraints.
- `evaluation.sla` accepts either `e2e_ms` alone or `ttft_ms` and `itl_ms` together. The two forms
  are mutually exclusive.

## Overrides

`--set` accepts dot-separated, schema-valid paths. The field does not need to be present in the
input YAML:

```bash
aisimulate predict \
  --stack dynamo \
  --config prediction.yaml \
  --set engine.workers.aggregated.parallelism.replicas=4 \
  --set router.policy=kv_router
```

An override cannot create an unknown field. Override a complete mapping when changing a tagged
configuration shape, such as `traffic.source`.

## Output

The output directory contains:

```text
aisimulate-output/
├── prediction.json
└── requests.jsonl
```

`prediction.json` preserves the Dynamo runner report, including summary metrics and available
Planner diagnostics. `requests.jsonl` is present only with `--capture-per-request`. `--format`
changes standard output but not durable files.

The command exits with `0` on success, `1` for execution failure, `2` for CLI or configuration
errors, and `130` when interrupted.
