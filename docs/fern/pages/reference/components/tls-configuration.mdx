title: TCP TLS
subtitle: Encrypt TCP streaming connections between frontend and workers
---

Dynamo supports opt-in TLS encryption on the TCP call-home streaming transport
(implemented by `TcpStreamServer` and `TcpClient`, handling both response
streams and request streams between frontends and workers). When enabled, all TCP
connections on this path are upgraded to TLS using
[rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) with the `ring` cryptographic
provider. When no TLS configuration is provided, the transport operates in
plaintext exactly as before.

## Environment variables

All TLS configuration is driven by environment variables. The Rust runtime
reads these directly at first connection (lazy initialization).

Both frontends and workers act as TCP server and client depending on the
stream direction (response streams: worker dials frontend; request streams:
frontend dials worker). All TLS env vars should be set on every pod.

### Server role (accepting connections)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH` | Path to the PEM certificate file. When set together with `DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH`, TLS is enabled on the TCP server. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH` | Path to the PEM private key for the server certificate. |

### Client role (dialing connections)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` | Path to the PEM CA certificate used to verify the peer's server certificate. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_INSECURE` | Set to `1` or `true` to skip certificate verification. For local development only. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_SERVER_NAME` | Override the TLS SNI hostname. Useful when connecting by IP to a server whose certificate has a DNS SAN. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | TLS handshake timeout in seconds (default: 3). |

## CLI flags

The same configuration is available via command-line flags on all backends
(vllm, sglang, trtllm, tokenspeed) through `DynamoRuntimeArgGroup`:

```
--tcp-tls-cert-path PATH      Server certificate (PEM)
--tcp-tls-key-path PATH       Server private key (PEM)
--tcp-tls-ca-cert-path PATH   CA certificate for server verification (PEM)
--tcp-tls-insecure             Disable certificate verification
--tcp-tls-server-name NAME     Override TLS SNI hostname
--tcp-tls-handshake-timeout N  Handshake timeout in seconds (default: 3)
```

The frontend (`dynamo.frontend`) also accepts `--tcp-tls-cert-path`,
`--tcp-tls-key-path`, and `--tcp-tls-ca-cert-path`.

## Quick start

Generate a self-signed certificate for local testing:

```bash
# Generate CA
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=DynamoCA"

# Generate server cert with SAN
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem \
  -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

openssl x509 -req -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem \
  -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 365 -copy_extensions copyall
```

Both frontend and worker need the same flags (both act as server and client):

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --tcp-tls-cert-path server-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-key-path server-key.pem \
  --tcp-tls-ca-cert-path ca-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-server-name localhost \
  ...

python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --tcp-tls-cert-path server-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-key-path server-key.pem \
  --tcp-tls-ca-cert-path ca-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-server-name localhost \
  ...
```

## Kubernetes deployment

In Kubernetes, TLS certificates are typically delivered by a certificate
management system (e.g., cert-manager) and mounted into pods. Set the
environment variables on each component's pod template in the
`DynamoGraphDeployment` spec:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Frontend
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          env:
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem
  - name: VllmWorker
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          env:
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem
```

Both components need the same TLS env vars because each acts as both TCP
server and client depending on the stream direction.

> **Note:** A future PR ([#10809](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/10809))
> will add operator-level TLS configuration via `InfrastructureConfiguration`,
> allowing TLS to be configured once at the platform level and auto-injected
> into all DGD pods without per-component env var setup.

## Design notes

- TLS configuration is cached after the first TCP connection via `OnceCell`.
  Certificate rotation requires a process restart.
- The TLS handshake is spawned per-connection on the server side so the accept
  loop is never blocked by a slow handshake.
- When server and client TLS configurations are mismatched (e.g., server has TLS
  but client does not), a warning is logged at startup.
- An empty CA certificate file is detected at load time and rejected with a
  clear error message.
