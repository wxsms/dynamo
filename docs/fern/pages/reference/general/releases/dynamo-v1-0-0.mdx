      body: "Dynamo now serves a range of generative modalities—text, image, and video—across all three major inference frameworks. Text-to-image generation is available through both vLLM Omni and SGLang image diffusion pipelines, and text-to-video through SGLang, vLLM Omni, and TensorRT-LLM Wan T2V, with experimental MJPEG streaming for real-time video output. Encoder disaggregation matured with a new EncoderCacheManager and content-addressed hashing, enabling multimodal encoder outputs to be cached and reused across workers. Embedding transfer between workers uses NIXL to minimize latency, and multimodal-aware KV cache routing places requests based on media content for better cache hit rates.",

Dynamo expanded its agentic capabilities with reasoning content management for DeepSeek v3.2, GLM-4.7, and Kimi-2.5—including interleaved thinking support where reasoning and tool calls alternate within a single response. New tool call parsers for GLM-4.7, MiniMax-M2, and Kimi K2/K2.5 broaden the set of models that can drive tool-use workflows. Agentic frameworks that target OpenAI or Anthropic can now connect to Dynamo directly via new `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages` endpoints, removing the need for adapter layers. Guided decoding now enforces JSON schema constraints on model output across vLLM and TensorRT-LLM, ensuring tool calls and function arguments are always valid structured data.",

The public Python API was streamlined—deprecated types like `Component`, `Namespace`, and `CancellationToken` were removed, and endpoint methods were consolidated. These changes make the SDK smaller, more consistent, and easier to maintain.\n\nSee the [Deprecations](deprecations.mdx#v100) ledger for migration details.",

LoRA support expanded with routing-aware adapter placement, memory-aware allocation, and multimodal LoRA with Kubernetes deployment examples.

The result: the Dynamo Router sustains 170M ops/s—42x faster than what we shipped in Dynamo v0.1.0 and enough to handle planetary-scale inference workloads (we think).\n2. [Full-Stack Optimizations for Agentic Inference](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/dev/digest/agentic-inference) tackles the visibility gap between agent harnesses and inference stacks. Claude Code and Codex know what's urgent—but the inference engines handling the workloads didn't, until now. The new `nvext.agent_hints` API lets harnesses pass scheduling priority, cache retention, and speculative prefill hints directly to the engine.",

## Looking Ahead

Dynamo v1.1.0 is targeted for April 29, 2026. Here's a small preview of what's already taking shape:

### Longer Contexts, Lower Cost

FlexKV manages KV cache across HBM, host memory, and SSD so long-context and high-concurrency workloads don't hit GPU memory limits. Instead of dropping requests when HBM fills up, the system spills KV blocks to cheaper storage tiers and pulls them back on demand.

### Resilient Routing at Scale

The KV indexer gains P2P state recovery and automatic ZMQ gap replay, keeping prefix matching correct through node failures without manual intervention. Multi-model and multi-tenant isolation ensures that shared clusters route requests to the right cache even when multiple models share the same infrastructure.

### Unified Observability

Forward pass metrics on the event plane and Loki log aggregation with unified OTLP ingestion bring metrics, traces, and logs into a single pipeline. Operators debugging latency or throughput issues in disaggregated deployments no longer need to correlate data across separate tools.

## Patch releases

### v1.0.1 — Mar 16, 2026

#### Summary

Dynamo v1.0.1 is a patch release to Dynamo v1.0.0 with **critical bug fixes** and **expanded model support**. Key fixes resolve a TensorRT-LLM startup crash on CUDA 13.1 caused by a `cutlass-dsl` packaging mismatch, and restore OpenAI API logprobs compliance where `bytes` and `token` fields were not populated when routing through Dynamo Frontend. This release also enables experimental Kimi K2.5 model support by adding DeepSeek V3 architecture tokenizer handling and fixing tiktoken multi-byte streaming panics.

**Base Branch**: `release/1.0.0`

#### Bug Fixes

- **TensorRT-LLM CUDA 13.1 Startup Crash:** Fixed startup crash where a `cutlass-dsl` stub crashed the TensorRT-LLM import chain on CUDA 13.1. This was a [known issue in v1.0.0](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/tag/v1.0.0) that blocked MoE models on Blackwell GPUs, including the Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 TensorRT-LLM recipe. (#7393)
- **Kimi K2.5 Tokenizer and Streaming:** Added DeepSeek V3 architecture support for Kimi's BPE tokenizer pattern and fixed worker thread panic on incomplete multi-byte sequences during streaming inference. Enables serving nvidia/Kimi-K2.5-NVFP4 and other Kimi K2.5 models that use the DeepSeek V3 `model_type` with a tiktoken tokenizer. (#7424)
- **OpenAI Logprobs Fields:** Fixed `bytes` and `token` fields in logprobs responses always returning `None`/empty when routing through Dynamo Frontend. Affected vLLM backend; direct backend queries returned correct values but requests routed through Frontend did not. (#7404)

### v1.0.2 — Apr 22, 2026

#### Summary

Dynamo v1.0.2 is a patch release focusing on **Frontend correctness fixes**, **DGDR-driven Kubernetes deployment robustness**, **rolling-update flexibility**, and **guided-decoding input hardening**.

Key fixes restore real stream metadata in non-streaming responses with tool calls, correct Kimi K2.5 tokenizer special-token handling that caused TensorRT-LLM to reject requests, and add byte-length and nesting-depth caps to the OpenAI guided-decoding path.

On the deployment side, DGDR-created DynamoGraphDeployments now derive their name from the parent DGDR, DGDR-managed ConfigMaps cascade-delete with their parent, the Operator no longer thrashes on foreground cascading deletion, and per-WorkerSet MDC checksum validation enables rolling updates with divergent worker configuration under the same Model.

**Base Branch**: `release/1.0.1`

#### Full Changelog

##### Kubernetes Deployment

- **DGDR-Driven DGD Naming:** Fixed Profiler-generated DynamoGraphDeployment naming so that DGDs derive their name from the parent DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest (`<DGDR>-dgd`) instead of from topology alone (`<backend>-<agg/disagg>`) (#7835), eliminating namespace-level name collisions when multiple DGDRs share the same backend/topology and respecting user-provided names from `spec.overrides` when present.
- **DGDR ConfigMap Owner References:** Added Kubernetes owner references to ConfigMaps created by DGDR (#7881) so that DGDR-managed ConfigMaps are cascade-deleted with their parent.

##### Runtime

- **Per-WorkerSet MDC Checksum Validation:** Scoped Model Discovery Card checksum validation from per-Model to per-WorkerSet (#8278), enabling rolling updates where different WorkerSets under the same Model can carry different configuration (e.g. tool-call parser) without draining existing workers first. Mismatches are still rejected when a new worker joins an existing WorkerSet, but cross-WorkerSet checksum drift is no longer a hard error.

#### Bug Fixes

- **DGD Cascading Deletion Thrashing:** Fixed Operator behavior under foreground cascading deletion of DynamoGraphDeployments (#8212) so the Operator no longer thrashes the resource during teardown, ensuring clean DGD deletion in Kubernetes garbage-collection scenarios.
- **Stream Metadata Preservation:** Fixed OpenAI Frontend stream finalization that overwrote real `id`, `model`, and `created` fields with hardcoded placeholders (`stream-end`, `unknown`, `0`) when a tool-call parser combined streamed chunks into a non-streaming response (#8281), restoring correct response metadata for non-streaming tool-call requests.
- **Per-Node GPU Topology in DGD Builder:** Fixed thorough-mode MoE config enumeration in the Planner/Profiler that ignored `numGpusPerNode` and produced unschedulable candidate DGDs on multi-node clusters (#8281). Worker GPU resource limits are now clamped per node and `multinode.nodeCount` is set for workers that span multiple nodes.
- **Kimi Tokenizer Special Tokens:** Fixed Rust tiktoken tokenizer handling of reserved-token fallback names for Kimi K2.5 (#7898), resolving prompt-token inflation that caused TensorRT-LLM to reject requests with negative `default_max_tokens` and enabling correct serving of `nvidia/Kimi-K2.5-NVFP4` and other Kimi K2.5 models.
- **Guided-Decoding Input Bounds:** Added byte-length and nesting-depth caps to OpenAI guided-decoding input validation (#8349) — `guided_grammar` 64 KiB, `guided_regex` 32 KiB, `guided_whitespace_pattern` 1 KiB, `guided_json` 256 KiB serialized with a nesting-depth cap of 64 — bounding pathological inputs before they reach the downstream guided-decoding backend.
