subtitle: Install the monitoring stack and enable metrics, logging, and tracing for Dynamo deployments
---

Dynamo emits three signals — **metrics** (Prometheus), **logs** (structured text or JSONL, exportable to Loki), and **traces** (OpenTelemetry, exportable to Tempo). This page installs the backends that collect them. Enabling each signal is a matter of setting a few environment variables per process or deployment.

## Signals at a glance

| Signal | Turn it on with | Collected by |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Metrics | `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` (workers/router); the frontend serves metrics on its HTTP port | Prometheus |
| Traces | `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED=true` + an OTLP endpoint | Tempo |
| Logs | `DYN_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT=jsonl` for console JSONL; `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED=true` to export | Loki |
| FPM traces | `DYN_FPM_TRACE=1` or `--fpm-trace` | Rotating gzip JSONL files |
| Health status | `/live` and `/health` endpoints | Supervisors or Kubernetes probes |
| Request traces | `DYN_REQUEST_TRACE=1` or `DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_RECORDS` | Files, NATS, stderr, or OTLP logs |

`OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED` is the master switch for both traces and logs — without it, neither leaves the process even when Tempo and Loki are healthy. Dynamo supports OTLP over `grpc` and `http/protobuf`. Use `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` for a shared collector or signal-specific endpoint variables for separate destinations. For the full variable catalog — defaults, per-signal grouping, and the Kubernetes operator presets — see [Environment Variables](../../reference/observability/environment-variables.mdx).

For scheduler telemetry, see [Observe a Local Deployment](../../cli/operations/observability.mdx#capture-forward-pass-metrics). For replay metadata or request payload capture, see [Observe a Local Deployment](../../cli/operations/observability.mdx#capture-and-replay-requests).

> [!NOTE]
> Prometheus metric families are registered lazily: each label set is created the first time it fires, so a freshly-started process shows empty metric families until the first relevant request. An idle cluster does not mean scraping is broken.

## Kubernetes stack

On Kubernetes, install the monitoring backends once, then enable signals per deployment — see [Observability](../operations/observability.mdx) under Operations for the per-deployment steps. The Dynamo operator wires metrics scraping automatically (it adds a `PodMonitor` to every managed pod), so the only one-time work is installing Prometheus, the exporters, and the logging stack.

### kube-prometheus-stack

Install Prometheus, Grafana, and the Prometheus Operator. The selector flags let Prometheus discover `PodMonitor` and `ServiceMonitor` resources created outside its own Helm release (such as the ones the Dynamo operator creates):

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace \
  --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.podMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues=false \
  --set-json 'prometheus.prometheusSpec.podMonitorNamespaceSelector={}' \
  --set-json 'prometheus.prometheusSpec.probeNamespaceSelector={}'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Dynamo install command in the [Installation Guide](install-dynamo.md#kube-prometheus-stack) sets `dynamo-operator.dynamo.metrics.prometheusEndpoint` to point the operator at this Prometheus. Set it there, in one pass, rather than here.
>
> An older form of the discovery flags used `--set ...podMonitorNamespaceSelector.matchLabels=null` (and the same for `probeNamespaceSelector`). The `--set-json '...={}'` form above is equivalent and preferred; use one form or the other consistently, not both.

kube-prometheus-stack bundles **node-exporter** by default, which supplies the node CPU, system load, and container resource panels on the Dynamo dashboard. Verify it is running:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset -A | grep node-exporter
```

If you run a custom Prometheus instead of kube-prometheus-stack, deploy node-exporter separately as a DaemonSet.

### PodMonitors created by the Dynamo chart

Whether the platform chart creates PodMonitors is controlled by `dynamo-operator.dynamo.metrics.podMonitors.enabled`, which is tri-state:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `null` (default) | Auto-detect. Creates PodMonitors only when the prometheus-operator CRDs exist in the cluster, which requires a live cluster lookup and so works with `helm install` and `helm upgrade`. |
| `true` | Always create. Use with `helm template` and GitOps workflows, where CRDs cannot be detected and auto-detect would silently create nothing. |
| `false` | Never create, even when prometheus-operator is installed. |

When enabled, the chart creates these PodMonitors:

| PodMonitor | Selects | Scrapes |
|---|---|---|
| `dynamo-frontend` | `component-type: frontend` | port `http` (`frontendPath`, default `/metrics`) |
| `dynamo-worker` | `worker` / `decode` / `prefill` | port `system` (worker metrics), ports `system-0` / `system-1` when present (GMS shadow-failover), port `http` when present (frontend sidecar, also `frontendPath`), and port `nixl` when `dynamo-operator.dynamo.metrics.podMonitors.nixlTelemetry=true` |
| `dynamo-planner` | `component-type: planner` | port `metrics` |
| `dynamo-router` | `component-type: default` | port 9090 (`DYN_SYSTEM_PORT`), addressed by relabeling rather than a named container port |

Each endpoint matches on a named container port, so a pod that does not declare that port produces no scrape target for it rather than a failing one.

A frontend can move its own Prometheus endpoint by setting `DYN_HTTP_SVC_METRICS_PATH`. When it does, set `dynamo-operator.dynamo.metrics.podMonitors.frontendPath` to the same value. It defaults to `/metrics` and applies only to the two endpoints that scrape a frontend HTTP service: the `dynamo-frontend` monitor and the `dynamo-worker` sidecar endpoint on port `http`. The remaining endpoints scrape the system status server, which always serves `/metrics`.

> [!WARNING]
> A mismatch fails silently. Prometheus scrapes the old path, receives a 404, and every `dynamo_frontend_*` series disappears while the pods stay healthy and the targets still exist. The SLA planner reads TTFT and ITL from those series, so it reads zero and never scales up.

### DCGM exporter (GPU metrics)

GPU-utilization panels are populated by [dcgm-exporter](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-telemetry/latest/dcgm-exporter.html). Check whether it is already running (the NVIDIA GPU Operator installs it as part of its monitoring components):

```bash
kubectl get daemonset -A | grep dcgm-exporter
```

If the output is empty, install it via the GPU Operator or the standalone dcgm-exporter chart.

### Loki + Alloy (logging stack)

To collect pod logs into Grafana Loki, install Loki and the Grafana Alloy collector. This reference setup suits development and testing clusters (including Minikube and MicroK8s); use a high-availability configuration for production.

Set the namespaces once:

```bash
export MONITORING_NAMESPACE=monitoring    # where Loki is installed
export DYN_NAMESPACE=dynamo-system        # where Dynamo is installed
```

Install Loki in single-binary mode (local MinIO storage), then install Alloy pointed at it:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Loki
helm install --values deploy/observability/logging/values/loki-values.yaml \
  loki grafana/loki -n $MONITORING_NAMESPACE

# Alloy collector (k8s-monitoring chart), templated with the namespaces above
envsubst < deploy/observability/logging/values/alloy-values.yaml > alloy-custom-values.yaml
helm install --values alloy-custom-values.yaml \
  alloy grafana/k8s-monitoring -n $MONITORING_NAMESPACE
```

The Alloy values file forwards logs to Loki, restricts collection to `$DYN_NAMESPACE`, and maps the `nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type` and `nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name` pod labels into Loki labels so the logging dashboard can filter by deployment and component. Applying the Grafana datasource and logging dashboard, and enabling JSONL logging on a deployment, are covered in [Observability](../operations/observability.mdx#configure-structured-logs) under Operations.
