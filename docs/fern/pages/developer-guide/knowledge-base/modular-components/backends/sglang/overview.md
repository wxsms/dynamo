subtitle: SGLang engines run in Dynamo's distributed runtime with disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request cancellation.
---

## Use the Latest Release

We recommend using the [latest stable release](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/latest) of Dynamo to avoid breaking changes.

---

Dynamo SGLang integrates [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) engines into Dynamo's distributed runtime, enabling disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request cancellation while maintaining full compatibility with SGLang's native engine arguments. It supports LLM inference, embedding models, multimodal vision models, and diffusion-based generation (LLM, image, video).

## Experimental Sidecar

The experimental sidecar path runs the Dynamo worker outside SGLang and
connects through SGLang's native gRPC API. It keeps SGLang's native server and
argument surface while separating Dynamo and engine dependencies. See
[SGLang Sidecar](sidecar.md) for current readiness and launch examples.

## Prerequisites

- **CUDA toolkit headers** for bare-metal builds (e.g. `nvcc`, `cuda_runtime.h`). See [CUDA Requirements](../../../../../cli/installation/install-dynamo.mdx#system-requirements). Not required when running the pre-built `sglang-runtime` container.
- **`HF_TOKEN`** for gated models. Export it on every node that pulls the model weights, and accept the model license on the Hugging Face model page before launch:

  ```bash
  export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
  ```

## Installation

### Install Latest Release

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
uv pip install --prerelease=allow "ai-dynamo[sglang]"
```

This installs the latest stable release of Dynamo with the compatible SGLang version.

### Install for Development

<Accordion title="Development installation in a virtual environment (recommended)">
Requires Rust and the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`).

```bash
# install dynamo
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
uv pip install 'maturin[patchelf]' nixl
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
cd $DYNAMO_HOME
uv pip install -e .
# install sglang
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git
# you can optionally checkout any sglang branch
cd sglang && uv pip install -e "python"
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust-Python bindings build tool. The `patchelf` extra lets maturin patch native extension library paths during the build.

This is the ideal way for agents to develop. You can provide the path to both repos and the virtual environment and have it rerun these commands as it makes changes
</Accordion>

### Docker

Two paths are supported. Pick the one that matches how you plan to develop.

#### Pre-built Dynamo SGLang container (recommended)

Pull and launch the published `sglang-runtime` image from NGC. See [release artifacts](../../../../../reference/general/release-artifacts.mdx) for the current tag and CUDA variants.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
    --network host --shm-size=10G \
    --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
    --cap-add CAP_SYS_PTRACE --ipc host \
    -v $HOME/.cache/huggingface:/home/dynamo/.cache/huggingface \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/sglang-runtime:1.2.1
```

Mount the host Hugging Face cache (`-v $HOME/.cache/huggingface:/home/dynamo/.cache/huggingface`) so each container restart doesn't re-download model weights. The container runs as user `dynamo` (UID 1000), which is why the in-container path is `/home/dynamo/.cache/huggingface`.

#### Build from source inside upstream SGLang container

Pull and launch the upstream SGLang image, then build Dynamo from source inside it:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
    --network host --shm-size=10G \
    --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
    --ipc host \
    lmsysorg/sglang:v{sglang_version}
```

Install build dependencies and Rust inside the container:

```bash
apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq \
    build-essential libclang-dev curl git > /dev/null 2>&1

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

pip install maturin[patchelf]
```

Clone and build Dynamo:

```bash
cd /sgl-workspace/
git clone https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo.git
cd dynamo

cd lib/bindings/python/
maturin build -o /tmp
pip install /tmp/ai_dynamo_runtime*.whl

cd /sgl-workspace/dynamo/
pip install -e .
```

## Feature Interactions

SGLang is optimized for high-throughput serving with fast primitives, providing robust support for disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request migration. The matrix below shows which feature pairs are validated to work together.

> **Notes:**
> 1. **Multimodal + KV-Aware Routing**: Supported on Dynamo's SGLang image, which carries the upstream hash-forwarding patch. A custom SGLang build without that patch still serves the request, but routing degrades to text-prefix overlap. The worker probes `engine.async_generate` once at startup and stops forwarding `mm_hashes` when the build does not accept it; the frontend keeps deriving image-aware routing keys regardless, so the worker's internally computed hashes never line up with them and only the text prefix overlaps. Expect image-blind cache hits on such a build rather than an error. ([Source](../../../../../use-cases/multimodal-serving/multimodal-kv-routing.md))
> 2. **Multimodal Patterns**: Supports simple Aggregated **EPD**, **E/PD**, and **E/P/D** patterns. Traditional Disagg **EP/D** is not supported. ([Source](multimodal.md))
> 3. **Request Cancellation**: Cancellation during the remote prefill phase is not supported in disaggregated mode. ([Source](../../../concepts/fault-tolerance/request-cancellation-architecture.md))
> 4. **Speculative Decoding**: Code hooks exist (`spec_decode_stats` in publisher), but no examples or documentation yet.

## Quick Start

### Python / CLI Deployment

Start infrastructure services for local development:

```bash
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
```


Launch an aggregated serving deployment:

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/backends/sglang
./launch/agg.sh
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain why Roger Federer is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time"}],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 30
  }'
```
### Disaggregated Serving

Launch a disaggregated Qwen3-0.6B deployment (smallest model, useful for plumbing validation):

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/backends/sglang
./launch/disagg.sh
```

> **Performance caveat:** Qwen3-0.6B is small enough that the disaggregated pathway is dominated by transport overhead and will often look slower than aggregated. Use it for plumbing validation, not benchmarks. Switch to Qwen3-32B-FP8 or larger for realistic disagg numbers.

### Multi-Node TP

SGLang supports multi-node tensor parallelism via the native `--dist-init-addr`, `--nnodes`, and `--node-rank` flags. See [SGLang server arguments](https://docs.sglang.io/docs/advanced_features/server_arguments) for the canonical reference; the same flags work with `python -m dynamo.sglang`. For a Kubernetes deployment example, see [`disagg-multinode.yaml`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/examples/backends/sglang/deploy/disagg-multinode.yaml).

### Kubernetes Deployment

You can deploy SGLang with Dynamo on Kubernetes using a `DynamoGraphDeployment`. For more details, see the [SGLang Kubernetes Deployment Guide](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/examples/backends/sglang/deploy).
