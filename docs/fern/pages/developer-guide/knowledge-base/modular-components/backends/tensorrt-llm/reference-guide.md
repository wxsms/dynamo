## Argument Reference

The TensorRT-LLM backend accepts Dynamo-specific arguments (model loading, parallelism, batch limits, KV cache, disaggregation, and the experimental diffusion pipeline) plus the cross-cutting Dynamo runtime flags. For the complete field-by-field reference of every flag, default, and environment variable, see:

- [TensorRT-LLM Configuration](../../../../../reference/backends/tensorrt-llm-configuration.mdx) — the `DYN_TRTLLM_*` backend flags.
- [Runtime Configuration](../../../../../reference/components/runtime-configuration.mdx) — the `DYN_*` flags shared by every backend.

## Default Thinking Mode

To set the thinking mode used when a request omits an explicit control, pass
`--dyn-default-thinking-mode enabled|disabled` to the TensorRT-LLM worker or
set `DYN_DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE`. Request-level thinking controls, including
adaptive thinking, take precedence. See
[Deployment-Level Thinking Default](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/reasoning-parsing.md#deployment-level-thinking-default).

## Building a Custom Container

The Dynamo TensorRT-LLM image layers Dynamo on top of the upstream `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/release` container — it does not build TensorRT-LLM from source. To rebuild it locally, pin a different upstream TRT-LLM tag, or plug in a TRT-LLM image you built from source, see the [Building a Custom Container](../../../../additional-resources/tensorrt-llm-details/building-a-custom-container.md) guide.

## KV Cache Transfer

Dynamo with TensorRT-LLM supports three methods for transferring KV cache in disaggregated serving:
* NIXL with UCX (default)
* NIXL with Libfabric
* using UCX directly

For detailed information and configuration instructions for each method, see the [KV Cache Transfer Guide](../../../../additional-resources/tensorrt-llm-details/kv-cache-transfer.md).

## Request Migration

Dynamo supports [request migration](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) to handle worker failures gracefully. When enabled, requests can be automatically migrated to healthy workers if a worker fails mid-generation. See the [Request Migration Architecture](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) documentation for configuration details.

## Request Cancellation

When a user cancels a request (e.g., by disconnecting from the frontend), the request is automatically cancelled across all workers, freeing compute resources for other requests.

### Cancellation Support Matrix

| | Prefill | Decode |
|-|---------|--------|
| **Aggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Disaggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |

For more details, see the [Request Cancellation Architecture](../../../concepts/fault-tolerance/request-cancellation-architecture.md) documentation.

## Multiple Choices (`n`)

Dynamo forwards OpenAI-compatible multiple-choice requests to TensorRT-LLM using `n`. For an `n > 1` request on TensorRT-LLM's default deterministic decoding path, set `TLLM_ALLOW_N_GREEDY_DECODING=1` in the TensorRT-LLM worker environment. Without it, TensorRT-LLM rejects the request before generation.

If a test or deployment intentionally validates `n > 1` for that path, set:

```bash
export TLLM_ALLOW_N_GREEDY_DECODING=1
```

Scope this environment variable to the specific TensorRT-LLM worker or test configuration that needs `n > 1`. For Dynamo E2E tests, set it on the relevant `EngineConfig.env` rather than globally, and keep the client request OpenAI-shaped with `n` instead of adding `best_of`.

TensorRT-LLM documents `n`/`best_of` behavior and validates this guard as greedy decoding in [`tensorrt_llm/sampling_params.py`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/tensorrt_llm/sampling_params.py).

## Multimodal Support

Dynamo with the TensorRT-LLM backend supports multimodal models, enabling you to process both text and images (or pre-computed embeddings) in a single request. For detailed setup instructions, example requests, and best practices, see the [TensorRT-LLM Multimodal Guide](multimodal.md).

## Diffusion Support (Experimental)

Dynamo supports video and image generation using diffusion models through TensorRT-LLM. For requirements, supported models, API usage, and configuration options, see the [Text-to-Image](../../../../../use-cases/diffusion/workflows/text-to-image.md#tensorrt-llm) and [Text-to-Video](../../../../../use-cases/diffusion/workflows/text-to-video.md#tensorrt-llm) guides.

## Logits Processing

Logits processors let you modify the next-token logits at every decoding step. Dynamo provides a backend-agnostic interface and an adapter for TensorRT-LLM. For the API, examples, and how to bring your own processor, see the [Logits Processing Guide](../../../../additional-resources/tensorrt-llm-details/logits-processing.md).

## DP Rank Routing (Attention Data Parallelism)

TensorRT-LLM supports attention data parallelism for models like DeepSeek, enabling KV-cache-aware routing to specific DP ranks. For configuration and usage details, see the [DP Rank Routing Guide](../../../../additional-resources/tensorrt-llm-details/dp-rank-routing.md).

## Observability

TensorRT-LLM exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring inference performance. For detailed metrics reference, collection setup, and Grafana integration, see the [Observability Guide](observability.md).

## Disabling Python Cyclic GC for high concurrency benchmarks

Dynamo with TensorRT-LLM exposes `DYN_TRTLLM_SERVER_DISABLE_GC` to match the behavior of `TRTLLM_SERVER_DISABLE_GC` in `trtllm-serve`. When set, the TensorRT-LLM worker disables Python's cyclic garbage collector at startup so that generational GC pauses do not land on the request hot path. Reference-counted deallocation still runs normally — only the cycle collector is turned off.

```bash
export DYN_TRTLLM_SERVER_DISABLE_GC=1
```

This is most useful for high-concurrency benchmarks, where it boosts throughput and stabilizes TTFT/ITL measurements by removing GC-induced tail-latency spikes.
