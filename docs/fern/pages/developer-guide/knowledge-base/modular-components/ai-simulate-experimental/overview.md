AI Simulate is a standalone Python distribution. It provides inference-engine forward-pass
simulation, deployment simulation, and search without depending on `ai-dynamo`.

For an engine-only single replay run, use `python -m aisimulate.replay`. For a replay with Dynamo
Router, Planner, or online adapters, use `python -m dynamo.replay`. Both commands share their base
replay configuration; Dynamo extends it with adapter options. The selected runtime validates each
`--*-engine-args` JSON payload, so runtime-specific fields can differ. For configuration search, call
`Sweeper(runner_factory=...).run(config)` or start from an example under
[`aisimulate/examples/sweeper`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/aisimulate/examples/sweeper).

## Sweeper

[Sweeper](sweeper-experimental/overview.md) searches backend deployment settings against an injected replay runner.
Its core owns backend search, candidate orchestration, scoring, and the versioned `ReplaySpec`
contract.

Optional adapters extend the search without adding a Dynamo dependency to AI Simulate. The
`ai-dynamo` wheel registers the `dynamo.planner` and `dynamo.router` adapters. Selecting either
adapter imports its Dynamo implementation and adds a versioned runtime hook to the replay
specification.

KVBM search settings are deprecated and are not supported by the AI Simulate engine and replay
path. They have no adapter migration.

## Install

The `dynamo-planner` image builds and installs AI Simulate and Dynamo from the same source revision.
The AI Simulate wheel remains inside the image and is not published as a standalone release
artifact.

For source development, install AI Simulate, Dynamo, and the Planner dependencies from the
repository root:

```bash
uv pip install -e ./aisimulate
uv pip install --no-deps -e .
uv pip install -r container/deps/requirements.planner.txt
```
