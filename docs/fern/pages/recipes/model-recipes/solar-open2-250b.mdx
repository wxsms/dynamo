## Profiles

| Profile | Serving mode | GPUs | Context |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `agg-b200-chat` | Aggregated, two replicas, KV-aware routing | 4 | 1M |
| `disagg-b200-chat` | Disaggregated 1P:2D, round-robin routing | 8 | 1M |

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with B200 nodes and the Dynamo operator installed
- A `ReadWriteMany` storage class. `model-cache.yaml` requests 1200Gi, which holds
  the checkpoint alongside benchmark traces and artifacts; the checkpoint itself is
  about 153 GB.
- A Hugging Face token, as a secret named `hf-token-secret`, used by the download
  Job to fetch the checkpoint:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic hf-token-secret --from-literal=HF_TOKEN=<token>
```
- For the disaggregated profile, an RDMA/InfiniBand device plugin exposing `rdma/ib`
  on the GPU nodes. If your plugin advertises a different resource name, substitute it
  in the worker resource requests.

## Prepare the model cache

Edit `storageClassName` in `model-cache.yaml` first.

```bash
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/model-cache/model-cache.yaml
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/model-cache/model-download.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/model-download --timeout=2h
```

The checkpoint is approximately 153 GB. Both profiles share this cache.

## Deploy

Aggregated:

```bash
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/vllm/agg-b200-chat/deploy.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready \
  dynamographdeployment/solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-agg-chat --timeout=30m
```

Disaggregated:

```bash
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/vllm/disagg-b200-chat/deploy.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready \
  dynamographdeployment/solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-disagg-chat --timeout=30m
```

## Smoke test

Port-forward the frontend of the profile you deployed. For the aggregated profile:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-agg-chat-frontend 8000:8000 &
```

For the disaggregated profile:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-disagg-chat-frontend 8000:8000 &
```

Then, against either:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"solar-open2-250b",
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 12 times 7?"}],
       "max_tokens":128}'
```

Solar Open2 is a reasoning model. Short generations may return the answer in
`reasoning_content` with `content` empty; allow a larger `max_tokens` to see a
final answer in `content`.

## Benchmark

Both performance Jobs read a mooncake trace from the `shared-model-cache` PVC. The
trace is not part of the model download, so stage it first. The published figures use
`nim_turbo_8k_1k_70kv_chat_new_noschedule_short_15perc.jsonl` (1805 requests, mean
ISL 37.4k, mean OSL 1008), which ships in this repository under
`recipes/nemotron-3-ultra/perf/traces/`.

Copy it in through any running pod that mounts the PVC. Note that the worker pods
mount that volume at `/shared-model-cache`, while the benchmark Job mounts the same
volume at `/model-cache`, so the file staged below is what `TRACE_FILE` refers to:

```bash
TRACE=recipes/nemotron-3-ultra/perf/traces/nim_turbo_8k_1k_70kv_chat_new_noschedule_short_15perc.jsonl

# The traces are stored in Git LFS. A plain clone leaves a small pointer file in
# place of the data, so fetch the real contents first and check the size: the file
# is roughly 900 KB, not a few hundred bytes.
git lfs install
git lfs pull --include="$TRACE"
ls -l "$TRACE"

# Whichever profile you deployed:
DGD=solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-agg-chat      # or solar-open2-250b-vllm-b200-disagg-chat

# The workers mount the cache PVC; the frontend does not. Match the worker
# components by name rather than excluding the frontend, so that pods carrying no
# component-type label are not selected either.
POD=$(kubectl get pods \
  -l "nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=$DGD,nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type in (worker,prefill,decode)" \
  --field-selector status.phase=Running \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl exec "$POD" -- mkdir -p /shared-model-cache/traces
kubectl cp "$TRACE" "$POD:/shared-model-cache/traces/"
```

Set `TRACE_FILE` in the Job to match whichever trace you stage.

Then run the Job for the profile under test:

```bash
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/perf/perf.yaml          # aggregated
kubectl apply -f recipes/solar-open2-250b/perf/perf-disagg.yaml   # disaggregated
```

Each Job runs the trace once and writes its summary to `ARTIFACT_DIR`. To run it
again, delete the Job first and re-apply; Jobs are immutable, so re-applying over an
existing one fails.

## Runtime image

Both manifests pin a purpose-built runtime image by digest. It extends the
Dynamo 1.4.1 vLLM runtime with the Solar Open2 architecture and parser support
and a Dynamo frontend compatibility patch. The changes are Python-only.

The stock Dynamo 1.4.1 vLLM runtime does not serve this model — it has no Solar
Open2 model definition — so the pinned image is required rather than optional.
Pin by digest, not by tag.

## Configuration notes

### Both profiles

- **NVFP4 weights, FP8 KV cache.** Both manifests set `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`;
  the disaggregated profile additionally sets `--calculate-kv-scales`. FP8 halves
  KV bytes relative to BF16, which roughly doubles the KV pool and raises the
  realised prefix-cache hit rate.
- **MoE backend.** `--moe-backend flashinfer_trtllm` with
  `--enable-flashinfer-autotune`.
- **Attention.** FlashInfer is selected automatically. Note that FlashAttention
  is not compatible with an FP8 KV cache on this model and will fail at startup
  if forced.
- **Hybrid KV pages.** Solar Open2 has 12 grouped-query attention layers and 36
  KDA linear-attention layers. The effective KV page is a hybrid page of roughly
  1072 tokens at `--block-size 16`, not the block size itself. Tools that assume
  block size equals page size need adjusting.
- Speculative decoding is not supported on this checkpoint and is not enabled.

### Aggregated profile

- Two worker replicas at tensor parallel size 2, fronted by a KV-aware router
  (`--router-mode kv`, `--router-kv-events`) with a ZMQ KV-event publisher on
  each worker. KV-aware routing outperforms round-robin on prefix-reuse
  workloads.
- **Expert parallelism is left off.** It measured as neutral for aggregated
  serving on this checkpoint, so the simpler configuration is used.

### Disaggregated profile

- Separate prefill and decode workers connected by `NixlConnector`, with
  `kv_role: kv_producer` on prefill and `kv_role: kv_consumer` on decode.
- **The topology is one prefill worker and two decode workers** — TP4 with
  expert parallelism for prefill (4 GPUs), TP2 for each decode worker (4 GPUs),
  8 GPUs in total.
- **`VLLM_SSM_CONV_STATE_LAYOUT=DS` is required.** Solar Open2's KDA layers
  register as SSM layers, and their convolution state must cross the KV-transfer
  boundary. Without this variable the engine asserts during initialization and
  the workers will not start.
- **Each worker requests `rdma/ib` equal to its GPU count**, four on prefill and two
  on each decode worker. This is required, not optional: without it the device plugin
  does not inject `/dev/infiniband`, UCX falls back to TCP, and nothing logs an error.
  Verify inside a running worker with `kubectl exec <pod> -c main -- ls /dev/infiniband`
  and expect `uverbsN`, `umadN` and `rdma_cm`. One HCA per GPU is correct; requesting
  more measured worse. If your RDMA device plugin advertises a different resource name
  than `rdma/ib`, substitute it in both the requests and the limits.
- Transport is configured with `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=0`, `UCX_TLS=^cuda_ipc`,
  `UCX_RNDV_SCHEME=get_zcopy` and `UCX_MAX_RNDV_RAILS=4`. `UCX_MAX_RNDV_RAILS` tracks
  the number of HCAs per worker; adjust it if your nodes differ. `UCX_NET_DEVICES` is
  deliberately left unset; pinning it produced `NIXL_ERR_BACKEND`.
- **Per-user output throughput runs close to the floor.** The disaggregated profile
  clears the 50 tok/s target with little margin, and individual runs on contended
  hardware may land at or below it.
- **The frontend uses round-robin routing, not KV-aware routing.** This is
  deliberate. KV-aware routing improves the aggregated profile, but with a single
  prefill worker there is nothing for a prefix-aware router to choose between.
  KV-aware and load-aware routing were both measured on this topology and neither
  improved on round-robin.

## Known limitations

- The disaggregated profile delivers slightly lower per-GPU throughput than the
  4-GPU aggregated profile, at roughly an order of magnitude higher
  time-to-first-token. Prefer the aggregated profile unless independent
  prefill/decode scaling is the priority.
- The 1M context length requires sufficient KV capacity; reduce
  `--max-model-len` if deploying on a smaller GPU allocation.
- Speculative decoding is not available on this checkpoint.

### API compatibility

Some OpenAI-compatible surfaces do not behave as advertised. These originate in the
Dynamo frontend, are not specific to this model, and no recipe setting affects them.

- **Logprobs.** Requesting `logprobs` on `/v1/chat/completions` returns HTTP 500.
- **Responses API.** `store=true` succeeds but the response is not retrievable
  afterwards (`GET /v1/responses/{id}` returns 404). Unsupported parameters such as
  `frequency_penalty` are accepted and silently ignored.
- **Completions.** `stop_token_ids` with more than three IDs returns HTTP 500 rather
  than a 400.

### Reasoning budget and structured output

The recipe sets `reasoning_effort: high`. Generations are long: on GPQA Diamond the
median output is roughly 6,400 tokens, the 99th percentile 131,000, and the longest
observed 209,000. A small `max_tokens` therefore truncates the model mid-reasoning
and returns `finish_reason=length` with no final content, which shows up most often
on structured-output requests where the JSON never arrives in `message.content`.

Omit `max_tokens` and let the 1M context window bound the request, or set it well
above the reasoning length the workload needs. Values in the low thousands are not
sufficient for this model.

## Measured performance

Chat workload, 15% subset of the internal `nim_turbo` 8k/1k 70kv trace
(1805 requests, mean ISL 37.4k tokens, mean OSL 1008 tokens). SLA: p50 TTFT
below 5 s and p50 user output throughput at or above 50 tok/s.

| Workload | Recipe | Framework | SKU | Concurrency | System output tok/s/GPU | User output tok/s (P50) | TTFT P50 (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Chat (15% subset) | Aggregated, 2 replicas, KV-aware routing | vLLM | B200 | 20 | 216.88 | 52.02 | 308 |
| Chat (15% subset) | Disaggregated 1P:2D, round-robin | vLLM | B200 | 44 | 206.20 | 51.69 | 2277 |

Figures are measured with the profile's benchmark manifest (`perf.yaml` for
aggregated, `perf-disagg.yaml` for disaggregated). Neither manifest clears
server-side KV cache, so a run inherits whatever the workers already hold. For runs
that must start from a cold cache, restart the worker pods between them.
