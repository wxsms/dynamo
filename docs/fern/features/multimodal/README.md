title: Multimodal Model Serving
subtitle: Deploy multimodal models with image, video, and audio support in Dynamo
---

Dynamo supports multimodal inference across multiple LLM backends, enabling models to process images, video, and audio alongside text.

## Which Feature to Use

Dynamo provides support for improving latency and throughput for multimodal workloads, with image and video inputs, through the following features. Use them together or separately, depending on your workload characteristics:

| Workload | Feature | Benefit |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Workload where significant time is spent preprocessing. | Frontend media decoding | Move base64 decoding and pixel conversion off the worker's critical path, and use all CPU cores to preprocess in parallel. |
| Workload includes repeated multimodal content across requests. | [Embedding cache](embedding-cache.md) | Skip re-encoding repeated multimodal content. |
| Workload includes repeated multimodal content across requests, and multiple backend workers serve multimodal requests. | [Multimodal KV routing](multimodal-kv-routing.md) | Maximize KV cache hit rates for multimodal content. |
| Workload where media encoding is a bottleneck. | [EPD disaggregation](encoder-disaggregation.md) | Scale encoders independently of LLM workers. |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> These features currently support image and video inputs only. Support for audio modalities will be added in upcoming releases.
