"""Assert the published site actually carries its page-level component CSS.

Production sets `global-theme: nvidia`, which overrides the project `css:` and
`js:` entries and the custom `footer:` (Fern's docs.yml schema documents the
override). Components that deliver their CSS through a page-level <style>
block survive it; anything relying on main.css does not. That failure is
invisible before merge -- PR previews delete the theme -- so this runs against
the published site after publish.

Each check asserts a selector appears as a CSS *rule* (followed by `{` or `,`),
not merely as a class name in markup. A page can be full of `class="foo"` while
the rule that styles it is absent, which is exactly the failure mode.

CDN propagation and Fern's publish pipeline can lag, so the CDN returns HTTP
200 with the *previous* HTML while the new page is still propagating. `fetch()`
would return that stale body immediately and the selector check would fail on
a healthy publish. The retry loop therefore covers both transport errors *and*
a successful body that does not yet carry the rule. Only after every retry
still lacks the rule is the page recorded as a failure.

The regex helpers are the release gate's core assertion, so `--test` exercises
them against a small table of matching-minified, class-only, adjacent-name,
and both-rule-and-markup cases -- boundary or escaping changes cannot silently
invert the result.

Usage:
    python3 check_published_styles.py [--base URL] [--retries N] [--delay SEC]
    python3 check_published_styles.py --test

Exits 1 with the failing page/selector pairs listed.
