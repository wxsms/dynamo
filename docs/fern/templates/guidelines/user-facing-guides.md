title: Writing User-Facing Guides
subtitle: Create quickstarts, installation pages, and tutorials for Kubernetes, CLI, and use-case workflows.
---

User-facing guides help readers get Dynamo running or use it to complete a task. They live in the
Kubernetes Guide, CLI Guide, and Use Cases, and follow one of three patterns: quickstart,
installation, or tutorial.

For guidance on choosing between user-facing, knowledge-base, and reference content, see the
[Documentation Content Guidelines](docs-guidelines.md). For prose, formatting, links, terminology,
and validation requirements, see the
[Documentation Style Guide](../../pages/community/contributing/documentation/documentation-style-guide.md).

## Choose the Owning Tab

Choose the tab based on the reader's goal and execution environment.

| Tab | Use it for |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes Guide | Core Dynamo workflows performed with Kubernetes resources, DynamoGraphDeployment (DGD) or DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest (DGDR) specifications, Helm, and `kubectl` |
| CLI Guide | Core Dynamo workflows performed with local Python processes, containers, shell commands, or repository scripts |
| Use Cases | Features and applications that build on the core Kubernetes or CLI deployment workflows |

Put foundational installation and model-deployment workflows in the Kubernetes or CLI Guide. Put a
workflow in Use Cases when its primary purpose is applying Dynamo to a feature or application, such
as tool calling, multimodal inference, or observability.

### Kubernetes Guide

- Show configuration in the Kubernetes-native surface readers must edit, such as a DGD or DGDR
  specification or Helm values. Do not show only a worker flag or environment variable and leave
  readers to determine how to pass it through Kubernetes.
- Make commands copy-ready by defining reusable values such as versions, image tags, and namespaces
  as shell variables. Avoid bracketed placeholders when a variable can make the sequence directly
  executable.
- Keep local-process examples in the CLI Guide unless they are necessary to explain or debug the
  Kubernetes workflow.

### CLI Guide

- Use local Python processes, containers, shell commands, or repository scripts as appropriate for
  the workflow.
- When a launch script demonstrates the workflow, show the core command that it runs and explain the
  arguments readers need to understand. Link to or embed the script as supporting material rather
  than presenting it as a black box.
- Keep operator-specific resources and commands in the Kubernetes Guide.

### Use Cases

- State at the beginning whether the feature supports Kubernetes, CLI, or both. Make every
  copy-ready example match the supported execution path.
- Use tabs when the Kubernetes and CLI paths follow the same sequence. Use separate sections or
  pages when their procedures differ materially.
- Center the guide on the feature or application. Link to foundational Kubernetes or CLI setup
  instead of repeating it.
- For a multi-page use case, use the section landing page as the overview and organize distinct
  workflows or subtopics as child pages.

## Choose a Guide Type

| Guide type | Reader goal | Typical placement |
|---|---|---|
| Quickstart | Reach a first working result | The primary Kubernetes or CLI entry point |
| Installation | Prepare a cluster, host, dependency, or integration | Kubernetes or CLI installation sections; a use-case section only for unique prerequisites |
| Tutorial | Complete a reusable task | Kubernetes Guide, CLI Guide, or Use Cases |

A page should follow one primary pattern. If a tutorial needs substantial environment preparation,
link to an installation page instead of embedding a second installation workflow. If a page becomes
an exhaustive list of fields, flags, or defaults, move that material to Reference and link to it.

## Write Quickstarts

The site has one primary quickstart for Kubernetes and one for local CLI usage. Keep them as the
shortest reliable path to a working result.

- Use a minimal, copy-ready workflow.
- Choose one representative default instead of presenting configuration decisions.
- Show the success signal directly.
- Exclude architecture diagrams, implementation detail, tuning, and optional branches.
- Link to installation, tutorials, the Developer Guide, and Reference for additional detail.

Quickstarts are few and deliberately curated, so they do not need a generic starter template.

## Write Installation Pages

Use installation pages for prerequisites that readers must prepare before following a tutorial.

- Treat the main Kubernetes and CLI installation pages as the canonical baseline.
- Do not repeat baseline steps such as installing the GPU Operator or Dynamo platform in a
  branch-specific installation page.
- Document only what readers must add, replace, or configure differently from the baseline.
- End with a direct verification that proves the dependency or environment is ready.
- Keep feature usage and deployment workflows in tutorials.

## Write Tutorials

Tutorials are concise, action-oriented walkthroughs for completing a task.

- Put prerequisites before the procedure and link to canonical installation pages.
- Use the Fern `<Steps>` component for the main sequence.
- Keep one primary action in each step.
- Explain the decisions users must make and the configuration values that materially affect the
  result.
- Keep architecture, implementation detail, exhaustive options, and field definitions in the
  Developer Guide or Reference.
- End with a request, status check, or other direct verification.

Describe a reusable workflow rather than one narrowly tailored deployment. Keep examples concrete
and copy-ready. Use tabs when readers follow the same sequence with different backends, deployment
modes, providers, or environments.

## Start from a Template

Keep shared authoring guidance in this page rather than copying it into each environment directory.
The environment directories contain only starter files whose structure or examples differ by
execution environment.

| Page type | Kubernetes | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Installation | [Kubernetes installation template](../kubernetes/installation.mdx) | [CLI installation template](../cli/installation.mdx) |
| Tutorial | [Kubernetes tutorial template](../kubernetes/tutorial.mdx) | [CLI tutorial template](../cli/tutorial.mdx) |

For a Use Cases page, start with the Kubernetes or CLI tutorial template that matches the primary
execution path, then adapt the framing around the feature or application. Add a dedicated use-case
template only after multiple pages share a stable structure that the existing templates do not
capture.
