# vLLM sidecar

`dynamo-vllm-sidecar` connects a Dynamo worker to vLLM's native gRPC
`Generate` service. It is a standalone Rust executable.

## Supported

- Aggregated generation
- NIXL prefill/decode generation
- Token and text requests through Dynamo preprocessing
- Sampling, stop conditions, structured output, logprobs, cache options, and priority
- Opaque `kv_transfer_params` handoff

The initial protocol does not support multimodal input, LoRA, KV-aware data
parallel routing, encode workers, beam search, or `n > 1`.

## Run

Start vLLM with its released gRPC listener:

```bash
vllm-rs serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --grpc-port 50051
```

This listener is unauthenticated and plaintext. Keep colocated deployments on
loopback or a private interface. Remote access requires network controls or a
secure proxy.

Start the Dynamo worker explicitly:

```bash
dynamo-vllm-sidecar \
  --vllm-endpoint 127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

Use `VLLM_GRPC_ENDPOINT` instead of `--vllm-endpoint` when the endpoint is
provided through the environment.

The sidecar opens eight gRPC connections by default. This avoided
connection-level throttling in high-concurrency sidecar tests. Override the
pool size with `--grpc-connections` or `DYN_SIDECAR_GRPC_CONNECTIONS`.

Connection startup uses a 30-second timeout per attempt, a one-second retry
interval, and a five-minute deadline for establishing the full connection
pool. Override them with `--grpc-connect-attempt-timeout-secs`,
`--grpc-retry-interval-secs`, and `--grpc-startup-deadline-secs`, or with the
corresponding `DYN_SIDECAR_GRPC_*` environment variables.

Distribution and container packaging for the executable are intentionally
deferred to a follow-up change.
