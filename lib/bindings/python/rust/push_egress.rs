//! Inverted (push-based) Python -> Rust response egress.
//!
//! The pull path in [`crate::engine`] costs two GIL acquisitions on arbitrary
//! tokio threads per response. Here the Python handler — already holding the
//! GIL — calls [`ResponseSender::send`] instead: the response is encoded to
//! request-plane bytes inline under that existing GIL and the resulting
//! [`PushFrame`] is enqueued on a bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc`, so the tokio
//! side only ever does `rx.recv().await` and never touches Python. Rationale
//! and measurements: #12845.
//!
//! Errors terminate the stream with the type `map_python_exception` assigned
//! them, which is what request migration and worker inhibition key on.
//!
//! Selected per handler by signature — [`handler_supports_push`] picks this
//! path for a handler declaring a `response_sender` parameter, which in
//! practice means the TRT-LLM `@push_egress_capable` decorator
//! (`components/src/dynamo/trtllm/request_handlers/push_egress.py`). There is
//! no environment variable: that decorator is the switch, so the two halves
//! cannot disagree about which path an endpoint is on. Every other Python
//! handler keeps the pull path verbatim.
//!
//! The sender reaches the handler as the `response_sender` keyword argument,
//! and only that way — the same parameter the signature check keys on.

mod tests {
    //! Unit tests for the pure-Rust parts of push_egress.rs.
    //!
    //! # Python linkage constraint
    //!
    //! This crate builds with `pyo3/extension-module`.  The linker does NOT
    //! include libpython in the test binary; Python symbols are supplied at
    //! runtime by the Python interpreter loading the `.so`.  Any test that
    //! compiles code which references Python C-API symbols — even unreachable
    //! branches — fails with "undefined symbol: Py_InitializeEx" etc.
    //!
    //! Confirmed: a trivial `prepare_freethreaded_python()` test produced
    //! "undefined symbol: Py_InitializeEx" from rust-lld.
    //!
    //! **Root cause for push_egress.rs**: `ResponseSink::send` takes
    //! `Python<'_>` / `Bound<'_, PyAny>`, and `ResponseSender` is a
    //! `#[pyclass]`.  A test that instantiates either — `response_channel`
    //! creates both — pulls pyo3 and the Python C API into the test binary's
    //! object graph.
    //!
    //! **What compiles**: [`PushFrame`] and everything downstream of it. The
    //! frame is a `Bytes` plus two scalars, and both the terminal-frame
    //! constructor and the ingress hand-off are pure serde, so the encoding
    //! contract — the part this module actually owns — is testable here.
    //! `send`/`close` and `handler_supports_push` are not; they are covered by
    //! pytest against the built `.so`.  Gaps are documented at the bottom.
