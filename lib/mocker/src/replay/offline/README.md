# Dynamo Offline Replay Adapters

The deterministic event loop, Generalized Mocker Engine driver, logical-worker
lifecycle, and report collector live in `aisimulate_core::replay`. This directory
contains only Dynamo-owned compatibility entrypoints and Router/Planner
composition:

- `entrypoints.rs` converts existing `MockEngineArgs` and workload inputs into
  a canonical `ReplaySpec`, then calls `aisimulate_core::replay::Replayer`.
- `extensions/kv_router` adapts Dynamo's existing `PlacementPolicy`-based
  Router implementation to the Replay composition boundary.
- `extensions/kv_events` converts neutral engine KV observations into the
  event batch consumed by the Dynamo Router policy.

See the [`aisimulate-core` crate](https://crates.io/crates/aisimulate-core) for the
virtual-time runtime and its liveness contract.
