//! # KV Manager (kvbm-logical G1 backend)
//!
//! Synchronous vLLM-flavour G1 block manager built on `kvbm-logical::BlockManager<G1>`.
//! Translates the mocker's `MoveBlock` protocol into the RAII lifecycle
//! (allocate → stage → register → drop) exposed by kvbm-logical.
//!
//! ## MoveBlock semantics
//!
//! - **Use**: prepare all active/inactive hits and fresh slots as one
//!   transaction, then commit the whole request atomically. Capacity exhaustion
//!   leaves ownership and sequence state unchanged so the scheduler can decide
//!   whether to preempt a running request.
//! - **Deref**: release one logical request owner. For `PartialBlock` this
//!   drops the unique `MutableBlock` and returns it to the reset pool. For
//!   `FullBlock` this decrements an explicit logical refcount; the final
//!   release drops the canonical `ImmutableBlock` and transitions the block to
//!   kvbm-logical's inactive pool (RAII return).
//! - **Promote**: PartialBlock (`MutableBlock`) → FullBlock (`ImmutableBlock`).
//!   Collapses onto an existing registered handle if the PLH / SequenceHash is
//!   already present; otherwise stages + registers a new block.
//!
//! ## Eviction backends
//!
//! Three backends are exposed via [`MockerEvictionBackend`]:
//! - `Lineage` (default) — parent-chain aware, evicts leaves first. Subsumes
//!   the `push_front` preemption-priority behaviour of the old `LRUEvictor`.
//! - `Lru` — simple recency-based LRU.
//! - `MultiLru` — 4-tier frequency-aware LRU (requires TinyLFU tracker).
