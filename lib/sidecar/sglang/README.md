# SGLang sidecar

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** These deployment examples and the standalone sidecar image
> are experimental and not yet packaged for distribution (the launcher module
> ships inside `ai-dynamo-runtime`). The manifests, flags, and behavior may change
> without notice.

`dynamo-sglang-sidecar` connects Dynamo's unified worker lifecycle to an
out-of-process SGLang engine through SGLang's native gRPC service. It is a
standalone Rust executable and is also compiled into `ai-dynamo-runtime` for
the importable `dynamo.sglang.sidecar` launcher.

Build and run it directly from the Dynamo workspace:

```bash
cargo build --release -p dynamo-sglang-sidecar
./target/release/dynamo-sglang-sidecar \
    --sglang-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:30001
```

There is no published image yet; the "Deploy on Kubernetes" section below builds
a minimal one from `Dockerfile`. Official packaging is deferred to a follow-up.

## SGLang-managed module contract

SGLang can load the Python entry point and supply the gRPC endpoint arguments:

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
    <args> \
    --grpc-port 30001 \
    --sidecar dynamo.sglang.sidecar
```

The entry point configures Dynamo logging when `main()` runs, then calls the
private `dynamo._core.backend._run_sglang_sidecar(argv)` binding. The binding
prepends the executable name expected by clap, releases the GIL, and runs the
same unified worker lifecycle as the standalone executable.

## Deploy on Kubernetes (quick start)

`deploy/agg.yaml` runs an aggregated deployment (a frontend plus one worker pod
that colocates the sidecar with an SGLang engine). `deploy/disagg.yaml` runs
disaggregated prefill/decode with NIXL KV transfer.

There is no published sidecar image yet, so you build and push your own from
`Dockerfile` — the same pattern as the TensorRT-LLM and vLLM sidecars.

> [!NOTE]
> The engine image must be a stock SGLang **v0.5.16+** build: the native gRPC
> server (`--grpc-port`) landed there, and Dynamo's `sglang-runtime` pins an
> older SGLang without it. `deploy/agg.yaml` uses `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.16`.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (**v1.29+**, or v1.28 with the `SidecarContainers` feature
  gate) with the Dynamo operator and a GPU node (multiple GPUs plus an RDMA fabric
  for `disagg.yaml`). The engine runs as a native sidecar (`initContainers` with
  `restartPolicy: Always`), which requires that version.
- `kubectl` set to that cluster, and a namespace to deploy into.
- A Hugging Face token for the model.
- A container registry you can push to and the cluster can pull from.

### 1. Build and push the sidecar image

Build a multi-arch image so it runs on any node — `amd64` (x86) or `arm64`
(GB200/Grace):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f lib/sidecar/sglang/Dockerfile \
  -t <your-registry>/dynamo-sglang-sidecar:1.3.0 --push .
```

### 2. Point the manifest at your image

In `deploy/agg.yaml`, set the `main` worker image to the one you just pushed.
If your registry is private, add `imagePullSecrets` to the worker pod spec.

### 3. Create the Hugging Face token secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic hf-token-secret \
  --from-literal=HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" -n <namespace>
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f lib/sidecar/sglang/deploy/agg.yaml -n <namespace>
```

Wait for the worker pod to reach `2/2 Running`:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -w
```

### 5. Send a request

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace> svc/sglang-sidecar-agg-frontend 8000:8000 &

curl -s localhost:8000/v1/models | jq .

curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":32}' | jq .
```

### Disaggregated

`deploy/disagg.yaml` runs prefill and decode as separate worker pods that hand
off KV cache over a bootstrap server + NIXL. It needs multiple GPUs and an RDMA
fabric, and both worker pods must reach `2/2 Running`.
