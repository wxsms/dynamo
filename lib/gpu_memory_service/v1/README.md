# GPU Memory Service V1

GMS V1 is an experimental, rank-local memory owner for engines restored by
Dynamo Snapshot. It is fail-stop: errors terminate the worker rather than
retrying, rolling back, falling back to native allocation, or continuing after
a partial wake.

## Snapshot assumptions

Dynamo Snapshot captures only after whole-engine GMS sleep. Restore preserves:

- the same Python and Torch process state;
- the same TensorImpls and post-partition StorageImpl graph;
- tensor layouts;
- GMS allocation IDs; and
- CUDA virtual-address reservations.

Model construction, model loading, and non-Parameter storage copy-out do not
run again after restore. The rank-local GMS sidecar survives separately and
retains committed weight allocations. Default-allocator copies are ordinary
process-owned Snapshot state.

KV TensorImpls, mapping records, allocation IDs, sizes, and VA reservations also
survive. KV physical backing and contents do not. Wake creates fresh backing
under the saved IDs and maps it at the preserved VAs before vLLM prepares the
cache for use.

## Ownership

`GMSV1Worker._maybe_get_memory_pool_context(tag)` is the vLLM routing seam.
vLLM calls its allocation-scope labels tags. V1 maps the recognized `weights`
and `kv_cache` tags to isolated GMS domains owned by one
`GMSV1SleepModeBackend`; every other tag follows vLLM's normal implementation.

```text
GMSV1Worker
  _maybe_get_memory_pool_context(tag)
    -> GMSV1SleepModeBackend
         owns one CUDAPluggableAllocator
         owns temporary weights MemPool + long-lived KV MemPool
         owns two GMSClientMemoryManager instances
              weights -> weights.sock
              kv      -> kv_cache.sock

sidecar per rank:
  weights.sock  -> GMSServerMemoryManager + independent allocations and sessions
  kv_cache.sock -> GMSServerMemoryManager + independent allocations and sessions
```

The pluggable allocator outlives both MemPools. Allocation callbacks route by
the active domain. Free callbacks route by VA ownership because Torch can free
outside the context that allocated the storage. C free callbacks cannot
reliably propagate Python exceptions, so the backend latches and surfaces the
first callback failure.

V1 reuses the existing
`gpu_memory_service.client.torch.extensions._allocator_ext` native shim
unchanged and permits one V1 allocator/backend owner per process. The default
V0 and `--use-v1` launch profiles are mutually exclusive. Mixed initialization
is unsupported by contract and prevented by launch/process topology; no runtime
cross-profile arbitration is provided or needed.

Both client domains use the same `GMSClientMemoryManager` class and the same
V0-style operations:

| Operation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `connect` / `disconnect` | Acquire or release the socket lease |
| `create_mapping` / `destroy_mapping` | Own one server allocation and local VA |
| `commit` | Change the same weights socket and mappings from RW to RO |
| `unmap_all_vas` | Drop imported handles but preserve IDs, sizes, and VAs |
| `reallocate_all_handles` | Recreate ephemeral server backing under saved IDs |
| `remap_all_vas` | Install server backing at saved VAs |
| `close` | Release local mappings and the socket |

Each Unix-domain socket is its lease. A writer excludes all other sessions.
Committed weights can have shared readers. Waiting writers have priority over
new readers. A same-socket commit changes RW to RO atomically. Disconnecting an
uncommitted writer clears its complete allocation epoch before another writer
is admitted. Reader disconnect only releases that reader.

The server retains CUDA handles rather than persistent export FDs. Each export
creates a transient FD, transfers it with `SCM_RIGHTS`, and closes the server
copy. Client import consumes and closes the received copy. The wire protocol is
a small typed `msgspec.Struct` MessagePack protocol; there is no JSON
compatibility path.

## Weight construction

V1 uses vLLM's normal model loader inside its broad weights allocation scope:

1. Connect `weights` RW and enter the temporary GMS weights MemPool.
2. Run model construction, loading, quantization, and post-load transforms.
3. Leave the GMS MemPool.
4. Copy live non-Parameter tensors from GMS storage to Torch's default
   allocator while preserving TensorImpl identity and non-Parameter aliases.
5. Synchronize CUDA.
6. Destroy the temporary weights MemPool, releasing cached and unreferenced
   blocks through the allocator free callback.
7. Surface any allocator callback failure.
8. Protect surviving Parameter mappings RO and commit the same socket RW to RO.

Destroying the MemPool is V1's pruning operation; it does not free allocations
still owned by live Parameter storage. The free callbacks remove only mappings
for blocks that are no longer retained, leaving the Parameter-backed allocation
set to commit.

The storage copy operates on each overlapping connected component of bounding
storage byte ranges, not on an entire StorageImpl and not once per tensor.
Relative aliases and offsets inside a copied component are preserved. Disjoint
components get separate storage. Absolute non-empty storage offsets may be
rebased. Mixed Parameter/non-Parameter aliasing is deliberately severed.

See `client/parameter_storage.py` for the detailed before/after diagram and
implementation.

The commit log reports Parameter span bytes, retained aligned GMS bytes,
uncovered retained bytes and ratio, copied-out bytes, and retained allocation
count.

## Sleep and wake

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as vLLM worker
    participant WM as weights manager
    participant KM as KV manager
    participant WS as weights server
    participant KS as KV server

    W->>WM: unmap_all_vas, disconnect RO
    Note over WS: committed weight backing remains
    W->>KM: unmap_all_vas, disconnect RW
    Note over KS: clear KV epoch
    Note over W: Dynamo Snapshot captures sleeping engine

    W->>KM: connect RW
    W->>KM: reallocate_all_handles, remap_all_vas
    Note over KS: fresh KV backing at preserved VAs
    W->>WM: connect RO against saved server identity/GPU
    W->>WM: remap_all_vas
```

Suspend order is weights then KV so the exclusive KV lease remains held until
local weight memory is asleep. Resume order is KV then weights.

Server nonce and physical GPU identity are saved on first connection. Every
wake must match them. V1 does not reconstruct models, retain KV contents, scan
raw mappings, validate model-specific layouts, or implement SGLang integration.

## Running V1

Start one V1 child per visible device:

```text
python3 -m gpu_memory_service.cli.server --use-v1
```

The supervisor discovers the visible devices and monitors the children. To
start one rank-local child directly:

```text
gpu-memory-service --use-v1 --device 0
```

Select the worker while retaining vLLM's normal load format:

```text
python -m dynamo.vllm ... \
  --worker-cls gpu_memory_service.v1.integrations.vllm.worker.GMSV1Worker
```
