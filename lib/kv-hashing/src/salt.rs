//! Canonical [`SaltHash`] derivation from a [`crate::Request`].
//!
//! The salt is the *prefix-cache isolation key*. Two requests that should not share
//! cache prefixes must produce different salt hashes; two requests that should share
//! prefixes must produce identical salt hashes.
//!
//! # Router parity
//!
//! For requests with no extra `salt`, this function reproduces the seed used by
//! `dynamo_kv_router::protocols::compute_block_hash_for_seq`
//! (`lib/kv-router/src/protocols.rs:79-82`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   (salt=None, lora=None)         → CHAIN_XXH3_SEED
//!   (salt=None, lora=Some(name))   → CHAIN_XXH3_SEED.wrapping_add(xxh3_64(name))
//! ```
//!
//! Producer events whose `block_hash` is `compute_block_hash(tokens, salt_hash)` therefore
//! match the router's `compute_block_hash_for_seq(tokens, _, BlockHashOptions { lora_name })`
//! byte-for-byte on the no-salt path — required for kv-router's indexers (which key on
//! both `tokens_hash` and the `seq_hash` chain) to find matches against consolidator-emitted
//! events.
//!
//! Multimodal data is **not** part of the salt — it is folded into per-block hashing
//! so that requests with the same image at the same global token position can still
//! share the prefix blocks before the image.
