//! RAII guard types that enforce the block lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! Every logical block in KVBM progresses through a fixed sequence of
//! states. The guard types in this module make those transitions explicit
//! at the type level: each transition consumes one guard and produces the
//! next. Dropping a guard at any point automatically returns the
//! underlying slot to the appropriate pool, so blocks are never leaked.
//!
//! # State machine
//!
//! ```text
//!                  stage / complete          register_block
//!   Reset ──────────────────────► Staged ─────────────────► Registered
//!     ▲                              │                          │
//!     │          reset               │                          │

//! # Public guard types
//!
//! - [`MutableBlock`] — `Reset` state.
//! - [`CompleteBlock`] — `Staged` state.
//! - [`ImmutableBlock`] — `Registered` state (cheap-to-clone strong handle).
//! - [`WeakBlock`] — non-owning reference to a registered block.
//!
//! Slot bookkeeping lives in `BlockStore<T>` (`crate::pools::BlockStore`);
//! `Primary` vs `Duplicate` is captured by an internal flag on
//! `ImmutableBlockInner` and the corresponding slot state.
