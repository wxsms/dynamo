//! RAII guards for blocks in the **Registered** state.
//!
//! [`ImmutableBlock`] is a cheap-to-clone strong handle backed by an
//! `Arc<ImmutableBlockInner<T>>`. The inner carries the slot's identity
//! ([`BlockId`], [`SequenceHash`], [`BlockRegistrationHandle`]) plus an
//! `is_primary` flag that decides the slot's drop transition:
//!
//! - **Primary** (`is_primary = true`): the canonical holder of a sequence
//!   hash. Drop of the last clone moves the slot to `Inactive` so it can
//!   be evicted later.
//! - **Duplicate** (`is_primary = false`): a second physical block sharing
//!   the same hash. It carries a strong [`Arc`] reference to the primary
//!   inner so the primary cannot be evicted while a duplicate exists. Drop
//!   of the last clone resets the slot via `mark_absent`.
//!
//! [`WeakBlock`] is a non-owning handle that can be upgraded back to an
//! [`ImmutableBlock`] either via `Weak::upgrade` (fast path) or by
//! resurrecting an evicted block from the store's inactive pool through
//! the registry (slow path).
