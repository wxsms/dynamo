# Upgrade DALI past its own media-codec cleanup. Upstream restricted DALI's
# vendored ffmpeg build to drop the software h264/hevc/aac decoders
# (NVIDIA/DALI_deps#162, NVIDIA/DALI#6352), first released in 2.1.1; the base
# image here carries 2.1.0, which predates it.
#
# Upgrade rather than remove. The vendored libav*/libsw* set cannot be trimmed
# on its own -- every one of them is DT_NEEDED by libdali.so and its siblings, so
# deleting the codec libraries breaks `import nvidia.dali` outright -- and while
# nothing in this image imports DALI today, it belongs to TensorRT-LLM rather
# than to us. A version bump removes the codec surface without taking a package
# out of someone else's image.
#
# Measured on the shipped image: 2.1.0 registers 446 decoders including h264,
# hevc, aac, aac_fixed and aac_latm; 2.1.1 and 2.2.0 each register 440 with all
# five absent and vp8/vp9/mjpeg/av1 retained.
#
# Pinned exactly, not a floor. `>=2.1.1` resolves to whatever is newest -- 2.2.0
# at the time of writing -- which is a minor-version jump into a component this
# repo does not own, taken silently at build time. 2.1.1 is the smallest change
# that removes the decoders, so it is the one to take.
#
# A pin can go stale in the one direction that matters: if TensorRT-LLM later
# ships a base image with a newer DALI, installing 2.1.1 over it is a downgrade.
# The check below turns that into a build failure with instructions rather than a
# silent regression, which also makes this block self-retiring -- when upstream
# catches up, the build tells whoever is looking to delete it.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS TRANSITIONAL. It exists because the base image predates upstream's
# own cleanup. The guards after it and the bundled-libavcodec assertion in
# tests/dependencies/test_no_software_video_codecs.py are NOT transitional: they
# are the permanent statement of what this image may contain, and they must
# outlive the workaround.
#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal above: with
# VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets the venv and leaves the system-site copy in
# place. The guard enumerates what the library actually registers rather than
# trusting the version string, so a wheel that reintroduces a decoder fails the
# build. Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below, which matters more here than
# for a deletion: DALI's libraries are hash-named, so an upgrade RENAMES them and
# the squash COPY would otherwise leave the old codec-carrying copy in place
# beside the new one.

#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal and the DALI
# upgrade above: with VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets /opt/dynamo/venv and
# leaves the system-site copy in place. The venv is --system-site-packages, so a
# venv-only install would shadow the old version at import time while leaving it
# on disk under dist-packages, where the image inventory reads it. The guard
# checks the system interpreter specifically, so a venv-only install fails here.
#
# Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below. An upgrade renames the metadata
# directory (aiohttp-3.13.5.dist-info -> aiohttp-3.14.3.dist-info) and the squash
# COPY only replaces paths that match, so without dropping the old tree first the
# base image's dist-info would ship alongside the new one.
#
# Checked against the base's own constraints (datasets, fsspec), which cap nothing
# here. cp312 manylinux_2_28 wheels exist for x86_64 and aarch64, so neither
# architecture builds from source.
# The guard asserts on dist-info directories, not on an importable version,
# because those directories are what an image inventory reads and they are what
# a venv-only install or a missed whiteout would leave wrong. It requires exactly
# one, in range, so a surviving old copy beside the new one fails the build.
# Version-compared rather than glob-matched: a glob range silently stops matching
