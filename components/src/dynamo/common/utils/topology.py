"""Topology domain utilities for topology-aware KV transfer routing.

Workers read their topology placement (e.g. zone, rack) from files provided
by the deployment environment, and read KV transfer policy from environment
variables. Each visible, non-empty file name is treated as a topology domain
and its contents as this worker's value for that domain. The Rust runtime
derives canonical topology taints from the published topology domains.

Environment variables:
    DYN_TOPOLOGY_ENABLED: Set to "true" to enable topology reading.
    DYN_TOPOLOGY_MOUNT_PATH: Directory containing topology domain files
        (default: /etc/dynamo/topology).
    DYN_KV_TRANSFER_DOMAIN: Which topology domain the router should enforce
        for KV transfer constraints (e.g. "zone"). The file at
        {mount_path}/{domain} must contain the transfer-domain topology value.
    DYN_KV_TRANSFER_ENFORCEMENT: KV transfer enforcement mode, either
        "required" or "preferred" (default: "required" when a domain is set).
    DYN_KV_TRANSFER_PREFERRED_WEIGHT: Preferred-taint weight used when
        enforcement is "preferred".
