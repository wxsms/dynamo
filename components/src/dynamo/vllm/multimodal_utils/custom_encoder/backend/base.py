"""The author-written contract for a pluggable in-process vision encoder.

``VisionEncoderBackend`` is the **single surface an encoder author implements**.
It is a pure policy + compute backend: no threads, no futures, no event loop.
Dynamo owns all the *driving* — the dedicated actor thread, cross-request
coalescing, engine adaptation, and the lifecycle — via ``ThreadedMicroBatcher``
(the generic cross-request batcher) and ``AsyncVisionEncoder`` (the async
request-API glue). This module defines only the contract those drivers call.

The encoder runs in the **same process** as the aggregated vLLM worker (no
separate encode worker, no NIXL transfer): it turns image inputs into ordered,
producer-defined artifacts. The resolved downstream decoder selects an adapter
that validates those artifacts and constructs the final engine prompt.

Division of labour (author vs. Dynamo):

- ``build(model_id)`` — **actor thread, once.** Load weights / tokenizer; warm up
  to peak; if ``buckets`` is set (once CUDA-graph batching is supported), capture
  one CUDA graph per rung here so it is bound to the thread that later replays it
  in ``forward_batch``. Pick the device yourself (``"cuda"`` / the current device).
- ``preprocess(raw) -> Preprocessed{item, cost}`` — **off the actor thread,
  concurrent.** Deterministic, thread-safe, CUDA-free (fetch / resize / patchify
  on CPU/pinned memory). ``cost`` is a **scalar** — how much the item adds toward
  ``max_batch_cost`` (e.g. its visual-token count). Raise to reject a bad input —
  it fails only that image, before any GPU work. **Off by default:** override
  ``preprocess`` *and* set ``preprocess_concurrency > 0`` together to enable this
  pool. With the defaults (identity passthrough, ``preprocess_concurrency = 0``)
  there is no preprocess phase — ``preprocess`` is never called and raws go
  straight to ``forward_batch``. A mismatch (overridden ``preprocess`` with
  ``preprocess_concurrency`` left at ``0``) fails fast at startup.
- ``forward_batch(items, target_bucket=None) -> list[ArtifactT]`` — **actor
  thread, serialized.** ``items`` are a cost-bounded batch (summed ``cost`` within
  the budget). Fence (stream event + sync) and **copy outputs to CPU** before
  returning, so results are safe to consume from another thread. Returns one
  artifact per item, in input order. ``target_bucket`` is reserved for CUDA-graph
  batching, once supported (the ladder rung to pad to); it is ``None`` until then.
- ``close()`` — actor thread, on teardown. Release any thread-affine resources.

Attributes read **once at setup** (never per-request):

- ``max_batch_cost`` — the scalar dispatch ceiling the batcher packs up to; a
  *chosen* budget (a token budget when ``cost`` is a token count). ``None`` (the
  default) ⇒ **pass-through**: no cap (the author owns sizing).
- ``buckets`` — sorted graph ladder, forward-compatible (unused until CUDA-graph
  batching is supported). ``None``/empty ⇒ eager.
- ``preprocess_concurrency`` — size of the off-thread pool Dynamo runs
  ``preprocess`` on. ``0`` (the **default**) ⇒ no preprocess phase: raws go
  straight to ``forward_batch``. Set ``> 0`` (with an overridden ``preprocess``)
  for off-loop fetch / resize / patchify.

Batching is **one-dimensional**: Dynamo packs by scalar ``cost`` up to
``max_batch_cost`` and never inspects item shape — the author owns any
shape/padding concerns inside ``forward_batch``.

Raising errors
--------------

An exception raised anywhere in this contract reaches the HTTP client, and its
**type** — not its message — decides how:

- ``ValueError`` / ``TypeError`` ⇒ the caller's input is at fault. Dynamo maps
  these to ``Backend(InvalidArgument)``, answering **HTTP 400 with the message
  forwarded to the client verbatim**.
- **any other type** (``RuntimeError``, ``TimeoutError``, ``torch`` errors, …)
  ⇒ the engine is at fault. The caller gets a sanitized 5xx and the message
  survives in the server log only.

Pick the type deliberately. Reporting an out-of-memory or a driver fault as
``ValueError`` tells the caller its request was malformed and suppresses the
retry that would have succeeded; reporting a genuinely bad image as
``RuntimeError`` costs the caller the one message that would let them fix it.

.. warning::
   **A ``ValueError``/``TypeError`` message is published to the client.** Do not
   interpolate file paths, tracebacks, tensor dumps, model or weight
   identifiers, or any other server-internal state into one. Describe the fault
   in terms of the request ("image 2 is 1-D; expected a 2-D embedding"), and
   keep the diagnosis in a log line. Non-validation exception types are
   sanitized before they leave the process, so they may say anything.

Note the blast radius differs by method. A ``preprocess`` failure is scoped to
the one image that caused it, but ``forward_batch`` runs a batch coalesced
across *concurrent, unrelated requests*, and an exception there is delivered to
**every request in that batch**. A per-item fault therefore belongs in
``preprocess`` — raised from ``forward_batch`` it would tell unrelated callers
their requests were invalid.
