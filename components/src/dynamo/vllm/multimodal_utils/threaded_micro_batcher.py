"""Run a blocking ``fn(list[item]) -> list[result]`` on one dedicated worker
thread, coalescing items from concurrent async ``submit()`` calls into batches.

``ThreadedMicroBatcher`` is the generic execution mechanism behind
``AsyncVisionEncoder`` — no model/vision knowledge, torch-free. It owns:

- a **dedicated worker thread** that runs an optional ``on_start`` (e.g. build +
  CUDA-graph capture), then every ``fn`` call, then an optional ``on_stop`` at
  teardown — so anything thread-affine (CUDA graphs, the device/stream) is
  captured and replayed on the same thread;
- **eager batching by default**: whenever the worker is free it drains everything
  queued and runs it as one ``fn`` call, then repeats (no timer) — a lone item
  runs the next loop, and batch size auto-scales with load. Pass ``max_batch_cost``
  to **micro-batch** instead: the drained items are split into batches whose
  summed per-item ``cost`` stays within that budget (one-dimensional packing by
  ``cost`` alone; item shape is never inspected).

The caller speaks in opaque items plus an optional per-item scalar ``cost``
(computed off-thread, see ``Preprocessed``), so all model knowledge stays in the
caller. A request is finalised exactly once — its ``completion`` future resolves
only after *all* its items are delivered or failed — with every request-state
transition under one short lock, so the worker and a concurrent ``shutdown()``
never race. A worker crash fails every live request (no hung awaiter) via a
supervisor.

Cancellation tombstones the request so work that has not passed the final
pre-``fn`` dispatch check is dropped. A committed ``fn`` remains non-preemptible.
TODO: admission has no backpressure (``submit()`` always accepts).
