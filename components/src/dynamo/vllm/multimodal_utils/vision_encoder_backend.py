"""The author-written contract for a pluggable in-process vision encoder.

``VisionEncoderBackend`` is the **single surface an encoder author implements**.
It is a pure policy + compute backend: no threads, no futures, no event loop.
Dynamo owns all the *driving* — the dedicated actor thread, cross-request
coalescing, the embeds splice, and the lifecycle — via ``ThreadedMicroBatcher``
(the generic cross-request batcher) and ``AsyncVisionEncoder`` (the async
request-API glue). This module defines only the contract those drivers call.

The encoder runs in the **same process** as the aggregated vLLM worker (no
separate encode worker, no NIXL transfer): it turns image inputs into the
visual-token embeddings for each image, and Dynamo splices those embeds into a
mixed ``EmbedsPrompt`` at the placeholder positions (see
``embed_assembler.build_mixed_embeds``) for a text-only LM.

Division of labour (author vs. Dynamo):

- ``build(model_id)`` — **actor thread, once.** Load weights / tokenizer; warm up
  to peak; if ``buckets`` is set (once CUDA-graph batching is supported), capture
  one CUDA graph per rung here so it is bound to the thread that later replays it
  in ``forward_batch``. Pick the device yourself (``"cuda"`` / the current device).
- ``preprocess(raw) -> Preprocessed{item, cost}`` — **off the actor thread,
  concurrent.** Deterministic, thread-safe, CUDA-free (fetch / resize / patchify
  on CPU/pinned memory). ``cost`` is a **scalar** — how much the item adds toward
  ``max_batch_cost`` (e.g. its visual-token count). Raise to reject a bad input —
  it fails only that image, before any GPU work. **Off by default:** override
  ``preprocess`` *and* set ``preprocess_concurrency > 0`` together to enable this
  pool. With the defaults (identity passthrough, ``preprocess_concurrency = 0``)
  there is no preprocess phase — raws go straight to ``forward_batch``.
- ``forward_batch(items, target_bucket=None) -> list[torch.Tensor]`` — **actor
  thread, serialized.** ``items`` are a cost-bounded batch (summed ``cost`` within
  the budget). Fence (stream event + sync) and **copy outputs to CPU** before
  returning, so results are safe to consume from another thread and splice
  directly. Returns one ``(n_visual_tokens, lm_hidden_dim)`` **CPU** tensor per
  item, in input order. ``target_bucket`` is reserved for CUDA-graph batching,
  once supported (the ladder rung to pad to); it is ``None`` until then.
- ``close()`` — actor thread, on teardown. Release any thread-affine resources.

Attributes read **once at setup** (never per-request):

- ``image_token_id`` — the token id marking image positions in the prompt;
  **hardcode it for your model** (e.g. ``151655`` for Qwen3-VL's ``<|image_pad|>``).
  Dynamo uses it to locate each image span for the splice.
- ``max_batch_cost`` — the scalar dispatch ceiling the batcher packs up to; a
  *chosen* budget (a token budget when ``cost`` is a token count). ``None`` (the
  default) ⇒ **pass-through**: no cap (the author owns sizing).
- ``buckets`` — sorted graph ladder, forward-compatible (unused until CUDA-graph
  batching is supported). ``None``/empty ⇒ eager.
- ``preprocess_concurrency`` — size of the off-thread pool Dynamo runs
  ``preprocess`` on. ``0`` (the **default**) ⇒ no preprocess phase: raws go
  straight to ``forward_batch``. Set ``> 0`` (with an overridden ``preprocess``)
  for off-loop fetch / resize / patchify.

Batching is **one-dimensional**: Dynamo packs by scalar ``cost`` up to
``max_batch_cost`` and never inspects item shape — the author owns any
shape/padding concerns inside ``forward_batch``.
