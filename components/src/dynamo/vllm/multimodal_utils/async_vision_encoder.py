"""Serial async glue between the worker's event loop and a ``VisionEncoderBackend``.

This is the **eager** glue: it proves the splice path end to end with a
**direct call — no micro-batcher**. Per request it preprocesses the images off the
event loop, enforces request-level atomicity, and runs the author's
``forward_batch`` on a single dedicated **actor thread**, serialized — there is no
cross-request coalescing. A follow-up swaps this body for a
``ThreadedMicroBatcher`` (cross-request batching); the public surface
(``load`` / ``encode`` / ``get_image_placeholder_token_id`` / ``shutdown``) is
identical, so the worker integration does not change.

Why a single actor thread (not ``asyncio.to_thread``): build and every
``forward_batch`` run on the **same** thread, so an author that captures a CUDA
graph in ``build`` can replay it from ``forward_batch`` — the affinity the batched
version also guarantees. ``max_workers=1`` serializes forwards (FIFO).

Request-level atomicity: a gather-barrier sits between preprocess and
the forward — ``encode`` waits for *every* image's preprocess to settle and runs
the forward only if **all** succeed; on any failure it does no GPU work and raises
the request-level error, so a text-only LM never sees a partial result.
