"""Async glue between the worker's event loop and a ``VisionEncoderBackend``.

``AsyncVisionEncoder`` is the **Dynamo-owned** layer the worker talks to. It
turns the author's synchronous, thread-affine backend into an awaitable
``encode(raws) -> list[tensor]`` by:

- running ``backend.preprocess`` **off the event loop** on a bounded
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` (CPU-heavy fetch / resize / patchify must not serialize
  on the GPU actor thread);
- enforcing **request-level atomicity**: a gather-barrier between preprocess
  and submit — ``encode`` waits for *every* image's preprocess to settle and only
  submits if **all** succeed; on any failure it submits nothing (zero GPU work)
  and raises the request-level error, so a text-only LM never sees a partial
  result;
- handing the preprocessed items (with their off-thread-computed scalar ``cost``)
  to a ``ThreadedMicroBatcher``, which coalesces across concurrent ``encode`` calls
  by cost and runs ``backend.forward_batch`` on the single actor thread.

The backend's ``build`` runs on the batcher's actor thread (so a CUDA graph it
captures is replayed on the same thread) and its ``close`` runs there at
teardown. ``load`` fails fast: it re-raises a build error and resolves the image
placeholder id once, so a misconfigured encoder errors at startup, not on the
first request.
