"""Unit tests for dynamo.vllm.multimodal_utils.threaded_micro_batcher.

Pin the execution contract: on_start + every fn call (+ on_stop) run on one
dedicated thread (so CUDA-graph capture/replay share a thread), concurrent submits
coalesce into cost-bounded batches up to max_batch_cost (or pass-through when
None), eager-drain pulls all queued work when free, errors reach every awaiting
caller, and the shutdown lifecycle behaves.

``fn`` is ``fn(items)``; ``cost`` is a precomputed scalar that rides on
``submit(items, costs)`` (one-dimensional packing — no bucket_key, no ladder).

    """Two threads race start(); the winner parks inside on_start while the loser
    must already be rejected — one worker only.

    Deterministic regression guard for the double-start race: the winner blocks in
    on_start, so `_state` is still NEW when the loser races in. A state-only guard
    would let the loser through *here* (state == NEW), spawn a second worker, and
    run on_start twice; the fix also keys on `_thread` (published under the lock),
    so the loser is rejected while the winner is still parked. Blocking on_start
    forces the window every run (no reliance on scheduler timing).
