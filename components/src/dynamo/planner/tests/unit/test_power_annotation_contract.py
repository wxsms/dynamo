"""Contract test: the planner and Power Agent per-GPU power-limit annotation
keys must be byte-identical.

The two constants are intentionally duplicated rather than shared as a package
import: the Power Agent image copies three standalone files and does not install
the ``dynamo`` Python package, so a runtime dependency only to share one string
is not justified. This test is
the safety net that keeps them in sync.
