"""GPU budget enforcement primitives.

Two layers:

* **Pure math** (``compute_tolerance``, ``bounds_for_total``,
  ``proportional_clamp_pair``, ``proportional_clamp_single``, plus the
  power-budget helpers below): no I/O, no state, no logging. Shared by
  the builtin local planner state (where the budget is enforced
  intra-DGD by clamping the joint ``(num_prefill, num_decode)`` desired
  counts), the orchestrator engine adapter's final budget clamp, and the
  centralized GlobalPlanner (where it is enforced across DGDs by
  accepting/rejecting incoming ScaleRequests). Callers share the same
  ``tolerance`` / in-band check; only the action taken on a breach
  differs (local transforms counts, GlobalPlanner decides).

* ``_initialize_gpu_counts`` remains a deployment-bootstrap helper: it
  populates per-engine GPU counts from the DGD spec or CLI flags, with
  a virtual-mode fallback.
