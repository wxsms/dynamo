"""Inverted (push-based) Python -> Rust response egress for the TRT-LLM workers.

On the pull path Rust drives the handler's async generator, taking the GIL on
tokio threads once per response. Here the handler -- already on the event loop
holding the GIL when it produces a response -- hands it straight to a Rust
``response_sender`` instead, and Rust advances the generator once per REQUEST
rather than once per RESPONSE. Rationale and measurements: #12845.

Three invariants are load-bearing; breaking any of them is silent:

1. **Shape.** Rust drives both paths with ``demand_driven_python_stream``,
   which does ``getattr("__anext__")``, so push mode must return an **async
   generator** -- never a coroutine. It yields nothing and is advanced exactly
   once: that single ``__anext__`` runs the whole request, draining into the
   sender, then raises ``StopAsyncIteration``.

2. **Opt-in by signature.** ``handler_supports_push`` (Rust) tests
   ``"response_sender" in inspect.signature(handler).parameters``. Applying
   :func:`push_egress_capable` is what puts it there, so that decorator IS the
   switch -- there is no environment variable. It must stay OUTERMOST, and it
   must keep deleting its own ``__wrapped__``, which ``inspect.signature``
   would otherwise follow to the undecorated function and hide the parameter,
   reverting every endpoint to the pull path with nothing logged.

3. **The sender.** ``send(obj)`` once per response and ``close()`` on normal
   end -- and nothing on failure. Exceptions propagate out of the handler, so
   Rust classifies them with ``map_python_exception`` and terminates the
   stream with a *typed* backend error. Reporting them here instead, through
   ``close_with_error``, would flatten every failure to an untyped string:
   ``EngineShutdown`` would stop triggering request migration and worker
   inhibition, and a client's bad input would surface as an unknown server
   error. ``close()`` is idempotent, and Rust closes the sink when the
   generator finishes as a safety net.

    Turns ``async def generate(self, request, context)`` into a plain ``def``
    returning whichever object the calling Rust engine expects: an async
    generator draining into the sender when one is supplied (push), or the
    handler's own async generator untouched when none is (pull). The choice is
    made purely on whether a sender arrived -- Rust decides per call, and
    second-guessing it here could only produce a shape mismatch.

    Both arms are live in normal operation. Network requests arrive through the
    push ingress; in-process callers and the canary health check go through the
    pull engine registered in the local endpoint registry, which passes no
    sender. That is why the pull arm must keep working rather than being
    treated as a legacy fallback.

    Must stay the OUTERMOST decorator (invariant 2 in the module docstring).
    Any decorator that inspects what it wraps must sit *inside*, where it still
    sees a real async-generator function rather than this plain ``def``.
